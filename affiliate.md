Whereas, Diode has developed and desires to advertise, promote, market and distribute its Services, and whereas Affiliate desires to obtain the right to act as an independent affiliate of Diode with the non-exclusive right to market, promote and refer Customers to the Services. Therefore, by engaging with [the Diode Foundation's Referral Program](https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/terms.html) and subsequently using a Diode Referral Code to register Customer Leads or Subscriptions, Affiliate agrees to participate in Diode’s Affiliate Program (“Program”) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the following sections.

### 1. Appointment

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Diode grants Affiliate the non-exclusive, non-transferable right during the Term to: (a) market and promote the Services to Customer Leads in the Territory; (b) use the Services to solely demonstrate and market the operation and capabilities of the Services to Customer Leads; and (c) resell the Services to Customers in the Territory. Except as set forth herein, Affiliate shall make no other use of the Services or the Documentation or otherwise market or sell any other products or services of Diode other than the Services.

### 2. Customer Policies and Pricing
Customers who buy Subscriptions through this Program will be deemed to be Customers of Diode. Accordingly, Diode’s rules, policies, and operating procedures concerning Customer orders, Customer service, and Subscription sales will apply to those Customers. Diode may change policies and operating procedures, including pricing, at any time in keeping with the prevailing Diode Terms of Service for the Services.

### 3. Responsibilities of Affiliate
Affiliate will market the Services to potential Customers and will use commercially reasonable efforts to promote and enhance the use of the Services in a professional manner consistent with Documentation for the same Services. Affiliate may receive assistance from Diode with the Documentation, however, Affiliate will ultimately be solely responsible for the development, operation, cost, and maintenance of materials and activities related to the promotion of the Services and to the execution of any other duties or functions related to this Agreement. In addition, Affiliate will:

a) Acquire and maintain the knowledge and ability to autonomously coordinate a sale of Subscriptions to Customers;

b) Participate in such training programs as may be required by Diode;

c) Provide basic on-boarding and front line of support to Customers;

d) Make Customer Lead name and contact information available to Diode, and take other action as requested by Diode, so that Customer Leads can be reviewed for approval or rejection;

e) Participate in such business development discussions and review meetings with Diode as are necessary to maintain strong Customer Lead activity and;

f) Participate in quarterly review calls with Diode for performance, product and marketing updates;

g) Conduct business in a manner that reflects favorably on the Services and Diode;

i) Not make any false or misleading representations with respect to the Services or Diode;

j) Comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations applicable to Affiliate’s activities under or in connection with this Agreement.

### 4. Customer Lead Approval
In order to be paid a Commission, and prior to engaging in any sale of Subscriptions to a Customer Lead, or referring a Customer Lead to Diode, Affiliate shall register such Customer Lead with Diode, by submitting a Customer Lead registration form, accessible at: https://93skrhki.paperform.co and providing complete and accurate information regarding such Customer Lead, and the Affiliate’s role with respect to such Customer Lead relative to the purchase of Subscriptions from Diode. All Customer Leads, as well as any Subscriptions from such Customer Leads, are subject to the approval and acceptance by Diode in its sole discretion. Diode may reject any Customer Lead at any time in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, if there is a possibility that the Customer Lead is the focus of a pre-existing sales effort by Diode or another affiliate of Diode or presents a credit or liability risk. Diode shall notify the Affiliate if any Customer Lead is approved by Diode as a Customer or is rejected by Diode, without any obligation to provide any reasons therefore. Affiliate shall not earn any Commission with respect to a Customer Lead that has not been approved by Diode. Should Customer cancel their registered Subscriptions and later re-register with different credentials not clearly identified with the same Customer Lead, a new Customer Lead approval process will be required.

### 5. Commissions
In consideration of Affiliate’s performance hereunder, Diode shall pay Affiliate a commission (the “Commission”) of 10% of Adjusted Gross Revenue received by Diode, minus any Adjustments and Set-Offs, for at least the first 24 months of approved Subscriptions.  Commissions will continue past 24 months so long as the Affiliate remains in Good Standing. Commissions will be paid immediately if the Affiliate participates in Diode's automated payment system, or before the fourtieth day (40th) day following the last day of the month that the total Commission balance exceeds $100 USD. Except as provided herein, Affiliate shall receive no other sums, compensation, remuneration, fees, reimbursements, or payments from Diode and Affiliate waives any right to claim any such sums, compensation, remuneration, fees, or payments.

#### 5.1 Adjustments and Set-Offs
Commissions shall be subject to adjustment for refunds, non-payment by Customers, discounts, promotions, or other factors arising subsequent to the payment of Commissions. Such adjustments may be set-off or deducted from future and unpaid payments of Commissions.

#### 5.2 Disputes
Affiliate shall have a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of a Commission (the “Commission Dispute Window”) to dispute any amount remitted by Diode or request additional supporting documentation, following which Commission Dispute Window Affiliate may not dispute a Commission. Upon receiving a written dispute, Diode shall promptly furnish any additional documentation reasonably requested by Affiliate in order to verify the accuracy of each Commission. Diode shall reasonably cooperate as requested with any such examination. If the examination reveals that Diode has underpaid Affiliate, then Diode shall pay any unpaid amount that such examination reveals was due to Affiliate.

### 6. Term
The initial term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year from the Effective Date as set forth above. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew on a yearly basis unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein.

### 7. Termination

This Agreement does not create, and neither party will have any right in, or to the use of, any names, marks, logos, designs, and other brand designations of the other party (collectively, “Trademarks”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Affiliate will be granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use Documentation supplied by Diode to identify itself as an Affiliate Program participant, and for advertising and promoting Diode Services under this Agreement. In performing its obligations hereunder, Affiliate may refer to the Services by the associated Diode Trademarks, provided that such reference is not misleading and complies with any guidelines issued by Diode. Affiliate shall promptly notify Diode of any apparent infringement or threatened infringement of any Diode Trademark, and shall, upon written request by Diode, use its best efforts to assist Diode to restrain any such infringement of threatened infringement. Affiliate agrees it will not use, register, or otherwise appropriate any name, mark, or logo which is similar to or may be confused with any Diode Trademark.

Affiliate shall hold such information in strict confidence and shall not reveal the same, except for any information which is: (a) generally available to or known to the public; (b) independently developed by such party outside the scope of this Agreement; or (c) lawfully disclosed by or to a third party or tribunal. Affiliate may disclose the Confidential Information pursuant to any judicial or governmental request, requirement or order provided, however, Affiliate takes all necessary steps to provide prompt and sufficient notice to Diode so that Diode may contest such request requirement or order.

The parties agree that an impending or existing violation of these confidentiality provisions would cause Diode irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law, and agree that Diode may be entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief prohibiting such violation, in addition to any rights and remedies available to it.
