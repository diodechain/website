Diode and Tanssi are exploring a partnership that will bring Diode-enabled secure communications to Tanssi-enabled appchains, thereby reducing the effort to deploy industry-ready appchains. 

A growing number of organizations are deploying blockchain projects, but the amount of effort to integrate them securely with other blockchains, and with existing infrastructure, is high. A collaboration between Diode and Tanssi would make the process of bringing decentralized communication to appchain deployments both easy and secure. 

## Diode: Simplifying Decentralized Communications

Diode is a Web3 software company focused on secure communications.  In a world plagued by daily data breaches, Diode eliminates single points of failure and vulnerable third parties, simplifying communications security to just the end users.

The Diode Network is a cross-chain tunneling network secured by blockchain state.  The Diode Network makes it easy to communicate between EVM chains, and also between a chain and Web2 infrastructure.  Diode also provides applications that leverage the Diode Network to equip organizations with uniquely secure team collaboration and IT asset management.  

## Tanssi: Simplifying Appchain Deployment

The deployment of appchains, despite their advantages, presents considerable challenges. Traditional blockchain implementation is complex, and intricate infrastructure requirements often pose significant hurdles.   

Tanssi's mission is to simplify these complexities, streamlining the deployment process to make it more accessible and efficient for developers. Tanssi stands as a beacon of hope for developers navigating the complex landscape of blockchain application development. By harnessing Tanssi's permissionless and developer-focused protocol, appchain builders can turn their ideas into a working concept in less than an hour.

## Tanssi x Diode: Shaping the Future of Decentralized Digital Environments

Diode and Tanssi have the potential to collaborate on deploying a proof-of-concept (POC) appchain that combines Tanssi’s easy blockchain deployment with Diode’s secure communications, enabling Diode's capabilities to all Tanssi appchains. This POC is an EVM appchain based on Moonbeam that could evaluate how a rapidly deployable blockchain can securely integrate with existing Web2 infrastructure using zero trust networking. This off-the-shelf integration would allow industry to tune, deploy, and iterate the digital environments of the future. It would create the ultimate form of 'self custody,' where integrations with outside vendors and cloud assets can be automated and secured, enabling enterprises to exercise full control of their digital assets.

Diode is also joining "Let's Forkin Dance," Tanssi's incentivized testnet campaign that features both on-chain and off-chain quests.
