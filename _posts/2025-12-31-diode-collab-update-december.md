The Diode Collab app made strong improvements throughout December, delivering valuable improvements across versions v1.18.8 through v1.18.13.

**Reduced Memory Usage**
<br> Memory usage in the app has been decreased by around 50%, increasing the performance of the app noticeably for most users.

**New Discover Page Zone Cards**
<br>The community “Discover” Zone cards are redesigned to be smaller so that they are easier to browse.

**Add “Clear Notifications” to Zone Settings**
<br>A persistent notification bubble could appear from archived channels or old DMs for some users. The new “Clear Notifications” button in Zone Settings clears all notifications.

**Clarify Leave and Unlink Zone Actions**
<br> We’ve added an “Unlink” button for all roles and clarified warnings for Unlink vs Leave Zone:
- Unlink: removes the Zone from this device only; you can restore it anytime.
- Leave Zone: removes your account from all devices and deletes the Zone; if you’re the owner, it permanently deletes the Zone.

**Chat Icon for Unread Messages in All Members**
<br>The All Members list now shows a chat icon for members with unread messages, highlights “Pending” members, and allows sorting by Name or Role.

**Show Tip on Discover Page “+” Click**
<br>If a user clicks the Zone Selector “+” while already on the Discover page, a flash tip prompts them to choose an option.

**Embellish Team Stats**
<br>Admins/Owners can now see some member info on the stats screen.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including mobile not being able to find Zone from push notification, stalled join progress, a file creation failure, and the improvement of Canister downloads.
