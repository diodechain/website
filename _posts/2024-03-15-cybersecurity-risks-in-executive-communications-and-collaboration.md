It is ironic in many ways that some of the most significant cyber and regulatory risks that occur in enterprises and other organizations with national and global footprints, are caused by insecure communications between executives, board members, and trusted advisors like lawyers and consultants. This topic was explored at some length in a recent Wall Street Journal article titled [As Boards Focus More on Cybersecurity,, Are they Missing One of the Biggest Threats?](https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/cyber-security-internal-threats-4d4c70dd)

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, especially concerning senior executives and board members, the challenges and responsibilities are multifaceted. The oversight and strategic governance roles that these individuals play make them prime targets for cyber threats, not only due to their access to sensitive and valuable information but also through their interactions with external professional services advisors. 

This complex web of interactions underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that includes not just organizational protocols but also the personal digital hygiene of these top-tier professionals. A stark revelation from the the WSJ article highlights a significant oversight in many organizations' cybersecurity strategies. "The board members themselves, the people responsible for making sure a company is well-protected, could well become the weak link in an organization’s cyber defenses." This underscores the paradox where those at the helm of safeguarding corporate assets are also among the most vulnerable to cyber threats.

Further complicating this risk landscape is the interaction between senior leaders and professional services advisors. A McKinsey article titled [Hit or myth? Understanding the true costs and impact of cybersecurity programs](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/hit-or-myth-understanding-the-true-costs-and-impact-of-cybersecurity-programs) notes that "the very people who are closest to the data or other corporate assets can often be a weak link in a company’s cybersecurity program." 

This observation highlights the broader issue that internal actions and interactions, including those with external advisors, can inadvertently expose organizations to significant cyber risks. These vulnerabilities can arise from numerous factors, but often are a result from executives using their email as the main basis for communications and messaging with their board, colleagues, and advisors, along with using attachments to share files that include highly sensitive information​​.

To mitigate these risks, organizations must prioritize cybersecurity as a key component of their corporate strategy and culture. This involves fostering a robust culture of cybersecurity awareness and resilience that extends from the boardroom to every employee and encompasses all external collaborations. Regular cybersecurity education, simulations for board members and executives, and comprehensive evaluations of security protocols governing communications with professional services advisors are essential steps in this direction.

Moreover, the interconnected nature of modern business necessitates a collaborative approach to cybersecurity. As companies increasingly digitize their operations, understanding how critical assets and data are shared and protected becomes paramount. This includes being intentional in how to carry out the secure exchange of information among executives, their colleagues, and trusted advisors such as  lawyers and consultants, as well as other external partners. By adopting a holistic approach to cybersecurity, organizations can better protect their leaders and, by extension, their critical assets and reputation in the digital realm.

Despite the growing acknowledgment of cyber threats, there remains a disconnect at the executive level regarding the urgency and importance of how their choices and behaviors impact the organization's’ cyber risk profile. Using corporate unencrypted email and sharing unencrypted file attachments to collaborate on sensitive topics and strategic projects and transactions is a recipe for disaster. Just look at the recent news cycle and the prevalence of serious and embarrassing data breaches that are being discussed. 

Safeguarding collaborative efforts among senior executives,  board members, and trusted advisors from cyber threats requires a comprehensive and integrated approach. It involves not only enhancing their cybersecurity literacy and resilience but also extending protective measures to their interactions with external advisors.
