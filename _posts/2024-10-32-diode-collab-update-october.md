The Diode team has been working hard at updates and has published some great new features during the month of October. These have been released in Diode Collab v1.13.1 - 1.13.7.

**Add Member Count to All Members Page**
<br>We added the total team member count (all roles) to the top of the All Members page.

**Added Search Bars**
<br> Search bars are now available in the Quick Access bar for lists over 10 items and on other listing pages, including All Members, Channels, Links, Bookmarks, Endpoints, Domains, and Contracts.

**List Nickname in Chat Mentions**
<br> The nickname of a Team Member mentioned in chat is now listed in addition to the username.

**Redirect to home**
<br> The chat message “Mark unread” now redirects the main view to the Zone home when marking a message unread to help with unintended clearing of the unread notification bubble.

**Emojis in Nicknames** 
<br> Emojis can now be added into user's nicknames for further customization. 

**Reduce Markdown File Preview Size** 
<br> The size of the markdown file preview in chat messages, and in message replies, is now reduced to make reading chat history easier.

**Expand Team Search to Nickname or Username** 
<br> Search in the All Members page now allows searching on either the nickname or the username.

**Include Community Nodes in Connection Pool**
<br> Community routing nodes are now included as E2EE communication candidates. If a community node outperforms Diode-hosted nodes, it will be added to the connection pool for potential use.

**New Icon Menu for Quick Web Tunnel Access.** 
<br>The desktop taskbar icon now shows recently used tunnels for quick access. The menu is simplified and no longer lists all zones—open the app to see them.

**Toolbars Visible Over Long Lists** 
<br>Toolbars now stay fixed when scrolling through long lists (e.g., Team Members) to make actions easier.

**Warn of No Notification When Editing Mentions** 
<br> A warning now appears if you edit a mention after five minutes, indicating no new notifications will be sent. The app behavior remains unchanged; the warning is just for clarity.

**Doc Link Updates** 
<br> The doc links in the app have been updated to the new https://docs.diode.io site.


**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs such as layout issues on mobile pages, alignment of quick access bar titles on Android and Windows, broken channel icons, missing file viewing in private chats, and disrupted Web2/Web3 tunnels. Fixes also included preventing accidental zone deletion, correcting chat input errors when adding images, and ensuring reliable Zone folder creation during new joins.
