June brought a new round of improvements to the Diode Collab app with these updates now live in versions v1.17.5 to v1.17.9.

**Billing Entitlement to Create Canisters**
<br>Paid plans are now able to support ICP canisters by default! 

**Customizable Font Size**
<br>There is now a “font size” setting in your profile area - this allows you to configure your device to show text in whatever size is most comfortable for you.

**Invite Order**
<br>The ignored invites list is now ordered showing the most recently received invitation at the top of the list instead of the bottom.

**About Page Links**
<br>The Ignored Invites page now has a search field.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including new users being able to easily join large Zones, team member ordering in side bar by interaction, and associated weblinks getting removed after a file or folder is deleted.
