April brought even more improvements to the Diode Collab app as we continue moving forward on our 2025 roadmap. These updates have been released in Diode Collab v1.15.4 - 1.16.0.

**Encryption For All Profiles**
<br>All profiles opened or created in 1.16.0 or later are encrypted on disk. A single new PIN can be set to protect acess to all profiles, profiles now display a “Profile Moniker” for privacy, and while private chat files are encrypted, public chat files remain accessible to external programs. <br>
These additional features, combined with the profile encryption, can greatly increase your team’s information security in situations where loss of physical control of their device may pose a problem. 

**Auto-publish Community Zones**
<br>New Moonbeam-anchored Zones with 3+ members will automatically appear on the Discover page. However, even when someone joins the Zone, the contents remain private since new users join with limited "In Moderation" access and cannot see members, chats, or files. Upon a new member joining, Owners and Admins are notified and can approve or remove them. Unpublishing requires a paid plan.

**Added 'Unpause Network' Banner**
<br>If the network is paused from the system menu, the app now shows a banner to easily unpause it. This helps users avoid confusion when the app seems unresponsive due to a paused connection.

**Search Ignored Invites**
<br>The Ignored Invites page now has a search field.

**About Page Drafts**
<br>Unsaved changes to a Zone’s About page are now saved as a draft. When you return and click "edit," you can choose to continue where you left off.

**Allow In-Moderation Roles to Reply**
<br>Users in the “In Moderation” role can now reply to messages in chat.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including improving the join process for linked devices, Zone publication improvements, and shortening the load time for larger Zones.
