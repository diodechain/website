Privacy and security are critical for teams whose data and communications must stay protected. [Self-custody](https://diode.io/blog/diode-self-custody) (where users control their own encryption keys rather than relying on providers) ensures full control over communications without third-party servers, creating a secure collaboration foundation.

Two secure messaging platforms in this space are [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Diode Collab](https://diode.io/products/collab/). Both offer end-to-end encryption and privacy-first design, but differ in approach. Diode Collab is built for teams with full self-custody, giving organizations complete control over keys, customization and infrastructure via a decentralized network. Signal is designed more for individual consumers, storing keys locally but relying on provider-managed cloud servers for message routing, making it partially self-custodial and dependent on centralized infrastructure.

**Key Features of Signal**

*   **E2EE Messaging:** Signal uses the Signal Protocol, an encryption standard that ensures only the sender and recipient can read messages.
*   **Open-Source:** Signal's source code is publicly available for independent review and verification on Github.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Available for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Supports one‑to‑one chats, group messaging, voice calls, and video calls.
*   **Minimal Data Collection:** Signal requires only a phone number for registration and collects minimal metadata.

**Pros of Signal**

*   Industry-leading end-to-end encryption with the Signal Protocol.
*   User-friendly interface suitable for non-technical users. 
*   Fast, private direct messages for individuals or small groups.
*   Supports a wide range of devices and features, including group chats and media sharing. 
*   No ads or data monetization, funded by donations and grants.

**Cons of Signal**

*   Centralized servers introduce a single point of failure, even if encrypted. 
*   Requires a phone number, which may compromise anonymity for some users. 
*   Limited to messaging and calls, lacking broader collaboration features.
*   Data that Signal has in its custody (e.g. Phone number) could be vulnerable to regional data requests.

**Key Features of Diode Collab**

*   **End-to-End Encrypted & Self-Custody Messaging:** Messages are encrypted device‑to‑device with keys never leaving your devices, giving you full control and ensuring no servers can access your information.
*   **Privacy by Design:** No personal information (phone number, email, etc.) is needed to sign up, keeping accounts anonymous.
*   **Integrated Collaboration Tools:** Includes secure file sharing, note‑taking, and remote access to support team workflows.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Available on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and even Raspberry Pi, Diode is available for diverse use cases, from personal to enterprise. 
*   **Decentralized & Open-Source:** Operates on a peer‑to‑peer network using blockchain-based identity, removing reliance on centralized servers; source code is publicly available on Github.

**Pros of Diode**

*   Private messaging and collaboration for teams, with secure file sharing, group chats, and remote access to tools.
*   Fully decentralized, removing reliance on central servers and reducing outage or censorship risks.
*   Self‑custody of encryption keys, with no third‑party access to messages or data.
*   No personal information required to sign up, supporting anonymous use.
*   Open‑source and independently verifiable for transparency.
*   Works globally with secure “regional exits” to extend internal resources and tools without exposing sensitive data.
*   Free plan available, plus enterprise options to best meet the needs of different teams.

**Cons of Diode**

*   Steeper initial learning curve for non-technical users due to its decentralized setup.
*   Requires team members to be part of the same “Zone” for collaboration, which may add some complexity.
*   Less focused on casual messaging, as it also includes file sharing and note‑taking tools.

**Real-World Impact: Why Teams Choose Diode Collab to Collaborate**
