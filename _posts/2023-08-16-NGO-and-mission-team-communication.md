### Security for NGO and Mission Team Communication

Diode believes that technology should help humans thrive. It should enhance our ability to operate, create, explore, educate, and innovate - unhindered.

We understand that international NGOs, organizations, and mission groups have a similar desire for people to flourish.  In today's interconnected world, these teams grapple with securing communication channels amidst a diverse and changing landscape. Ensuring privacy and security while exchanging sensitive data is paramount. This is why Diode's goal is to remove obstacles, [enabling teams](https://diode.io/solutions/app/) to fulfill their purpose to serve, equip, develop, and empower people, even in the toughest global settings, while maintaining peak security levels with a decentralized platform.

**The Challenge of Secure Communication for NGO and Mission Organizations:**

International organizations often operate in isolated environments with little or no available organizational IT resources and standard tools often fall short in ensuring data privacy. Yet, effective communication with teams, partners, and stakeholders is still vital.

Diode addresses this by safeguarding people, contacts, and communication, filling the gaps left by traditional VPNs and cloud storage in terms of security and privacy.

**Encrypted Teams:** 

Diode introduces [end-to-end encrypted](https://diode.io/how-it-works/) (E2EE) features that fortify an organization's online communication. Mission teams can utilise anonymous and secure chat, group communication, online training, file collaborations, information wikis, repositories, and websites. Every aspect is designed to protect teams and their contacts, ensuring the utmost confidentiality.

**Zero Data Leakage:** 

Diode works without retaining user metadata, phone numbers, emails, or IP addresses, while offering users anonymity and pseudonymity. This approach safeguards both teams and contact networks from potential leaks and provides users the ability to increase their team’s digital sovereignty.

**Replacing Traditional VPNs:**

Diode's innovation replaces traditional VPN technology avoiding potential throttling and international IP address concerns. Internet traffic tunnels securely through the app, ensuring unimpeded access even in the most restrictive settings to organization resources, public websites, and information.

**Communication:**

Anonymous chat that shields identity with encryption allows for private and group messaging as Diode ensures that sensitive data remains confidential. Whether it's an international mission organization or company with a global team, Diode offers secure communication with easy to use tools that work for teams requiring agility. Teams can quickly and securely access each other no matter where they are in the world.
