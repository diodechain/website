Blockchain DePINs are an exciting new way to create better services for end users by unlocking the value in assets owned and operated by node operators.

Read below for more information and emerging use cases.


# What are blockchain DePINS?

DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) is basically the deployment of useful devices that are inseparably tied to blockchain wallets.  These useful devices provide some sort of service and are automatically rewarded by a blockchain token.  Sort of blockchain “Layer 2” services that are focused on a particular utility.  

The devices are almost always deployed and maintained by an ecosystem of third parties.  [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is an early example of one of the first successful DePINs (LoRA, WiFi, and cellular nodes-as-a-service) - their node operators provide wireless service to others, and are reward by receiving the [Helium token](https://www.helium.com/token).

# What is the Diode DePIN?

Diode is also a DePIN - instead of wireless service like Helium, Diode provides end-to-end encrypted routing services - a new type of secure infrastructure that can be used to connect any type of device and any type of application using end to end encryption.  All a device needs to communicate is its blockchain wallet - no other third parties are involved with the communication.

Diode nodes are emerging in every region of the world, providing better security (all in-region connections, blockchain perimeter anchoring can’t be tampered) and faster performance (shorter hops) than anything else in existence today.  

The nodes of the Diode Network make up an open, permissionless Zero Trust communication network. It is kind of as if the popular chat app, Signal, figured out how to make their E2EE infrastructure expandable by a community, and then made it available for everyone to build on top of.

Diode nodes are rewarded for the bandwidth they transfer by the [$DIODE token](https://diode.foundation/docs/token.html).

# DePIN use cases

A use case may be a fit for DePIN if regional distribution of nodes is key to the success of the project.  If regional distribution doesn’t matter, a DePIN approach could still make sense, but it is usually more about financing at that point - which could be a differentiated strategy depending on a few factors (see “other potential “Uber” use cases below).

Today's practical DePIN use cases are three:

- **IoT sensor services** - IoT devices that gather data about their environment and crowd source that data back to an aggregated view of the information can be a powerful DePIN.  A great example of this is the [QuakeCore Network](https://quakecore.com/) - they need to sense seismic activity in a region, but the devices need to be placed and maintained by someone.  The geographic distribution of sensing nodes is critical, as is the rewards for sensing activities to keep the node hosts interested in ensuring their nodes are up and running at all times.

- **Compute services** - Unused compute (graphics cards, servers) are interesting use cases.  Geographic location sometimes makes a difference in these systems (e.g. Internet egress location, regional cost of power, ISP co-location for speed), and certainly making underutilized compute available for a fee is an attractive offering to those owning the computing systems.  A notable example of this is [Akash](https://akash.network/) - they have a compute DePIN that is essentially a distributed data center that anyone can leverage.

- **Network services** - The ability to deploy network nodes geographically addresses a core of a key challenge in network engineering - that of coverage.  The more coverage your network has, the better service the network can provide to end-users.  A clear example of this for wireless networks is [Helium](https://www.helium.com/), and a great example for IP-based communication networks is [Diode](https://diode.io/).

## Other use cases

There are other potential “Uber”-like use cases that are close the to “Compute systems” use case - basically asset-as-a-service.  However, these can be awkward if the the metering of the asset can’t easily be automated.  For example, a crowd-sourced service that allows people to rent out recreational equipment from homeowners whose kayak (choose your equipment) is usually sitting around unused is a potential blockchain use case, but probably not a DePIN.  Other use cases, such as scooter fleets that can be unlocked by a mobile app, get more interesting because they can be automated like a Compute system.  However, there are usually significant economic hurdles to using a DePIN incentive structure if the availability of the asset type is not already sufficient enough to provide a high quality, dependable service.

# In Summary

DePINs are being used to provide better services thanks to their ability to leverage geographic node distribution and to automate payment to node hosts.  Today, they are most effective for collecting sensor data, making computing resources available, and providing network services.  As the building blocks for DePINs are made more widely available, because of their efficiency, it is likely we will see DePIN models used in place of traditional infrastructure networks.
