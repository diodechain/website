On March 1st and March 4th Diode hosted a live AMA on the Ambassador Program on our [X account](https://twitter.com/diode_chain)'s Space. CEO Hans Rempel led the AMA discussing the overview of the program and how people can get involved as well as answered a few questions, which we'll answer below.

*   **What is the Ambassador Program?**
    *   In short, the [Ambassador Program](https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/ambassador_program.html) is an interactive tool that we will be using to assist in the promotion of Diode software and the Diode Network as well as the supplying of DePIN infrastructure (Relay Nodes) to the Diode Network. People can register to be “Ambassadors” to promote Diode in their own region.
*   **Who are the Seed Ambassadors?**
    *   The Seed Ambassadors are the small group of regional ambassadors that Diode is choosing who are the only Ambassadors that will not need a referral code from other Ambassadors, nor will they need to host a Relay Node.
*   **How do referral codes work?**
    *   Referral codes are given from another Ambassador to someone who wants to register to be an Ambassador and host a Relay Node. The Ambassadors that refer other Ambassadors to join the network then receive rewards from not only their Relay Node traffic, but also from the Relay Node traffic of the Ambassador they gave a referral code to.
*   **What’s the difference between the Diode Network versus other communication networks when it comes to Relay Nodes?**
    *   To use an example: When communicating with someone in a place like Mexico City with the closest server in Dallas, traditional networks lead to slower and less secure communication because the communication has to go all the way from Mexico City to Dallas and back again. Diode's solution involves strategically placing relay nodes, such as one _directly_ in Mexico City, to ensure faster and more secure regional data transmission.
*   **I’m all in and ready to host a Relay Node…what do I need?**
    *   The Moonbeam partnership streamlines chain work to create lightweight Relay Nodes, needing fewer resources and adaptable to diverse hosting environments. Because of this, you can actually run your Relay Nodes on a home connection. While there are options such as regional VM providers and major platforms like AWS or Google, the preference is for regional providers to ensure widespread network presence, boosting overall efficiency.
*   **How will I know if I’m going to get my $20 back from hosting the node?**
    *   Every app that wants to communicate with the Diode network is being charged through the fleet contracts, acting as sponsorship pools for associated devices. Monthly, these contracts allocate funds as rewards for services. Relay providers get a share of rewards based on the ratio of devices using their service—e.g., if half use relay A and half use relay B, rewards are split equally.
*   **What happens to the current Diode miners with the move to Moonbeam?**
    *   The Diode L1 (current Diode Chain) is shifting to Moonbeam, a faster network with significant on-chain innovations. Moonbeam will become the primary platform for interacting with Diode tokens through the process of slowing down L1, but as of now there is no exact date that miners need to move. Rewards, including those from the bandwidth growth program, are exclusively in the new Diode token on Moonbeam.
*   **What are “quests" and how will they be managed?**
    *   As a part of promoting the usage of this program within Diode, we will provide some quests for additional engagement. From time to time quests will appear and once they are completed they will provide rewards to people who achieve the quests.
*   **Timing?**
    *   Our goal is to have the Seed Ambassadors who have registered for a Seed Ambassador slot receive their answer shortly. We want to begin giving referral codes for people to begin signing up other Ambassadors underneath the Seed Ambassadors by mid March. In regards to the transition from the Diode L1 mining to the Moonbeam Network, we do not have a set date in mind but if there is a date that is decided on, all users will know well in advance. 
*   **New Telegram Channel**
    *   We will be introducing a new Diode Community channel on Telegram alongside the currently existing Diode Telegram channel. As we anticipate newcomers with limited tech knowledge who have keen interests in relay nodes, we're also preparing resources on the [Diode Foundation](https://diode.foundation/docs/about.html). Token whitepapers and information on various growth programs will be available upon request to help users get started.
