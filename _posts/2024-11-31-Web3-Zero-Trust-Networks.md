Diode is a DePIN protocol that enables trustless secure and private communication using a cutting-edge technology called [Zero Trust Networking](https://diode.io/blog/open-approach-to-ztna). ZTN is rapidly replacing VPN as the go-to method for secure communication. Unlike VPN, ZTN is a more scalable, secure solution for today’s distributed workforce, especially with increased cloud adoption and remote work. 

ZTN will soon become the predominant way to communicate, with several governments and military sectors already adopting it. By bringing ZTN to the blockchain, Diode mitigates most of the single points of failure and leverages Web3 architecture to support novel DePIN use cases that can be built on top of the network.

### **Web3 Zero Trust Networks (Web3 ZTNA)**

Zero Trust networking requires a Trust Broker, but traditional [Trust Brokers have issues](https://diode.io/blog/trust-broker-security). A Web3 [Zero Trust Networks](https://diode.io/blog/open-approach-to-ztna) (Web3 ZTNA) can solve all of these drawbacks by not requiring the physical and cyber security needs for traditional Trust Brokers. Rather, Diode has created a Zero Trust network that mathematically secures the trustbroker, eliminating the existing vulnerabilities of physical access or cyber security concerns in the traditional Zero Trust network infrastructure.  

### **Problems solved by Web3 Zero Trust Networks (Web3 ZTNA)**

In our article "[The Need for an Open Architecture Approach to Zero Trust Networks (ZTNA),](https://diode.io/blog/open-approach-to-ztna)" we highlighted how Web3 Zero Trust Networks can improve flexibility, interoperability, and security in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. This approach ensures seamless integration with various technologies, prevents vendor lock-in, and enhances security with blockchain integration to protect against insider threats and social engineering. Open ZTNA also makes these benefits accessible to organizations of all sizes through a diverse, affordable environment.

### **Additional Advantages of Web3 Zero Trust Network (Web3 ZTNA)**

In addition to creating the solutions listed above, Web3 Zero Trust Networks (Web3 ZTNA) introduce new and integrated solutions for: 

*   Self-Custody Identities: A verified system-wide identity is required for each user to access any information. This identity must be recognized, authenticated, and then compared to the access control policies. In Diode’s case, a unique backup key is generated for each user’s profile. 
*   Global Routing: The solution enhances global routing by verifying user identities, device security, network isolation, and data access policies, ensuring that only authorized entities can route sensitive data across regions.
*   Massively Distributed PoPs: Enforces identity verification, device validation, network isolation, and strict data access policies, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can connect to and interact with resources at each Point of Presence (PoP).
*   SaaS App Support: Leveraging blockchain-based smart contracts to automate provisioning and ensure trustless security. These systems allow applications to function seamlessly in highly secure, air-gapped environments, offering enhanced protection against unauthorized access and data breaches while maintaining the ease of use expected from SaaS products.
*   Integrated Payments: Continuous verification of every access request and limiting access to only authorized users, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized transactions, data breaches, and cyber threats in payment gateways

### **Diode is Leading Web3 Zero Trust Network Innovation**

As of November 2024, Diode has over fifty public nodes online, with its community growing and expanding globally as more individuals bring their personal nodes online. These nodes are highly accessible, allowing anyone to run one and take a step closer to transforming the Internet into everyone’s private network.

New nodes come online weekly, extending our reach to more countries and creating new global communication points. Locations like Santiago de Querétaro, Doha, Taiwan, Sogndal, and more, enhance secure regional connections while enabling communication with the rest of the world. The best part? You can set it up in [under 3 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klh6KK_wNAM&t=8s).

### **Diode and Zero Trust**

Diode has implemented the [pillars of Zero Trust](https://diode.io/blog/pillars-of-zero-trust) across its systems, ensuring that all users within the ecosystem are verified and secure, leaving no room for data misuse or leaks. Diode has even gone a step further into offering [a more secure altnernative to VPN](https://diode.io/blog/does-vpn-protect-my-information) known as [ZTN (Zero Trust Network)](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/features/regional-tunnels/), which solves and addresses the main issues with VPN usage by providing the ultimate secure tunneling feature. 

By adopting Diode’s technology, you’re not just securing your data—you're helping to redefine the future of the Internet into a private, trustless, and decentralized network for everyone. Don’t miss out on the future of security—take control and help build the next generation of the Internet.
