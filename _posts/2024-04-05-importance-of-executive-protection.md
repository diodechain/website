Today, [digital executive protection](https://blackcloak.io/what-is-it-digital-executive-protection-personal-cybersecurity-for-your-executives/#:~:text=Simply%20stated%3A%20Digital%20Executive%20Protection,homes%2C%20and%20key%20online%20accounts.) extends beyond corporate networks—it's about protecting cybersecurity and privacy risks for executives. Often, the same devices are used for an executive's business and personal activities, which can result in cybersecurity risks for an organization. 

Executive and team collaboration includes communications with colleagues, partners, board members, or professional services providers (such as lawyers, consultants, bankers, or accountants). This communication often is done in a relaxed manner where the secure technologies used in other parts of an organization are not utilized.

To protect executives and teams digitally, employing secure messaging and remote access technologies prioritizing the privacy of personal information, devices, homes, and online accounts. Without this approach, executives and teams risk hackers aiming to exploit their activities to compromise sensitive and personal customer data entrusted to their organization.  

Diode uses such an approach where there is no third-party access when using any of the collaboration tools to where Diode itself doesn’t even have access to your information.

**Market/Regulatory Factors**

Digital privacy laws [globally](https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide) create a complex regulatory environment. In the US, regulations are inconsistent between States and federal authorities, posing challenges for compliance. This complexity demands extra care, especially for organizations in heavily regulated industries.

As [privacy rights evolved](https://www.skyflow.com/post/a-brief-history-of-data-privacy-and-what-lies-ahead), so did the significance of data privacy. Mid-20th-century data collection transitioned to today's internet era, with privacy concerns growing alongside online activities. Regulations such as GDPR and CCPA play a significant role in this environment, requiring companies to navigate to protect sensitive information.

**Increasing Threat Landscape**

The cybersecurity landscape, facing threats directed at large corporations and [mid-market enterprises](https://coretelligent.com/insights/navigating-the-rising-tide-of-cyber-attacks-insights-for-small-and-medium-sized-businesses/#:~:text=Cyber%20attacks%20on%20small%20and,can%20cost%20nearly%20%242%20million.), results in incidents costing small and medium-sized businesses an average of $25,000 per incident, leading to extended operational downtimes averaging 277 days. 

In recent years, ransomware attacks have surged in frequency and scope, expanding their targets from organizations with personally identifiable information (PII) to critical infrastructure and supply chain entities. This addition of ransomware, including triple extortion and ransomware as a service (RaaS), has intensified the complexity of the threat landscape. It holds a significant impact, being involved in [24%](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/Ransomware-trends-statistics-and-facts) of all breaches and affecting 66% of organizations in 2023. Relatively recent attacks on entities like the [British Royal Mail](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/16/royal_mail_recovery_from_ransomware/) and [Boeing](https://www.cshub.com/attacks/news/lockbit-hackers-publish-43gb-of-stolen-boeing-data-following-cyber-attack) underscore the consequences that ransomware can cause.

**Executive Collaboration and Unintended Risks**

Collaboration through messaging platforms poses significant risks, with [71% of global employees](https://www.veritas.com/news-releases/2021-03-10-71-percent-of-employees-globally-admit-to-sharing-sensitive-and-business-critical-data-using-instant-messaging-and-business-collaboration-tools-according-to-new-research-from-veritas), including 68% in the US, sharing sensitive data through these channels, exposing companies to compliance violations risks. Employees will also often retain copies of shared information on their own devices, heightening the vulnerability to fines and legal actions.With Email being a commonly used tool, it remains cybercriminals' [top choice](https://www.barracuda.com/reports/email-security-trends-report-2023) due to its high success rate and minimal effort required for attacks.

These communication tools are increasingly targeted by hackers seeking to exploit [executives' access to sensitive company information](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/information-security/article/53065624/one-overlooked-element-of-executive-safety-data-privacy). Personal data, varying from political affiliation to Amazon wish lists, fuels these crimes as companies legally collect this data that can be sold to bad actors. As a result, executives face heightened risks of "whaling" attacks, where individuals impersonate them to solicit money or information.

**Concerns and Essential Nature of Confidentiality**

Unauthorized access to confidential information poses risks such as data theft, fraud, system sabotage, and data destruction from weak authentication, phishing, password breaches, software vulnerabilities, and insider threats.Executives, responsible for critical operations and sensitive data, face heightened risks. With access to vital information like financial strategies and intellectual property, executives face severe consequences if compromised.

**Summary**

Enterprises and organizations must prioritize digital executive protection and take proactive steps to mitigate risks and ensure leadership safety.

While their organizations are often highly secure within their perimeters, there are typically vulnerabilities that are overlooked when it comes to secure communications among executives and senior team members.  Investment in comprehensive strategies to safeguard against digital threats at every level of your organization is essential for organizational stability and success.
