An ideal Zoom alternative is a secure and reliable solution for video calling - which will be found right with Diode. The Diode App prioritizes data safety in virtual meetings, providing a user-friendly experience while maintaining the highest level of security. In response to the growing concern for secure communications, the Diode App now will not only provided secure chat and file sharing, but also secure video calling within the app. With security in mind during this process, Diode continues to keep all of its features privacy-focused whereas other [organisations](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/zoom-rectifies-ai-data-collection-policy-after-raising-privacy-concerns/) tend to struggle with some privacy standards when it comes to their customer's data in relation to video calling or chatting.

This feature is advantageous for discussing sensitive information without the risk of leaks or data scraping, and it allows connections to individuals in restricted regions without the need for expensive and blockable VPNs. The video conferencing will be accessible through the Brave Browser via a Web2 tunneled link within your Diode Bookmarks in your selected Zone. This tool guarantees the security and encryption of your calls.

Some things Diode does to keep your calls secure:

1.  **In-Transit Encryption to Video Call Server**
    - Diode provides the in-transit encryption to video call servers that circumvents censorship and relies on mathematical security rather than a 3rd party certificate authority.
2.  **Secure Tunneling**
    -  Secure tunneled user access reduces metadata leakage and safeguards sensitive information through in-app or Brave browser bookmarks.
3.  **Secure Web Portals**
    -  Ensures secure information exchange through shareable links, accessible from any web browser, catering to regulated industries and facilitating collaboration with anyone from anywhere.

At Diode we work to put the tools in your hands so that you can have secure communication from anywhere, to anyone, at anytime.Â
