Many people are looking for a secure alternative to Zoom for video and audio conferencing.  Diode has a solution that prioritizes data safety in virtual meetings, providing a user-friendly experience while maintaining security. In response to the growing concern for secure communications, the Diode now integrates with secure video calling within the app. Diode's commitment to privacy and security is different from other [organisations](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/zoom-rectifies-ai-data-collection-policy-after-raising-privacy-concerns/) who may have other priorities when it comes to their customer's data.

Secure conferencing is a necessity when discussing sensitive or regulated information.  It also allows connecting with individuals in restricted regions without the need for expensive and blockable VPNs. Diode's video conferencing uses a browser-based experienced that is launched by a tunneled bookmarks in your selected Zone. This tool guarantees the security and encryption of your calls.

Some things Diode does to keep your calls secure:

1.  **In-Transit Encryption to Video Call Server**
    - Diode provides the in-transit encryption to video call servers that circumvents censorship and relies on mathematical security rather than a 3rd party certificate authority.
2.  **Secure Tunneling**
    -  Secure tunneled user access reduces metadata leakage and safeguards sensitive information through in-app or Brave browser bookmarks.
3.  **Secure Web Portals**
    -  Ensures secure information exchange through shareable links, accessible from any web browser, catering to regulated industries and facilitating collaboration with anyone from anywhere.

At Diode we work to put the tools in your hands so that you can have secure communication from anywhere, to anyone, at anytime.Â
