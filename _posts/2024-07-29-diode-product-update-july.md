The Diode team has been working on great new features and fixes this July for our Diode users (v1.11.14 - 1.12.02).

**Multiple Profiles**
<br> We now support multiple profiles! You can create multiple usernames and choose which to use for different Zones, keeping your username isolated to specific interactions. This is especially useful for managing separate accounts for work, personal, or other purposes. Read more details [here](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/features/working-with-multiple-profiles-accounts/). 

**Easy-To-Copy Invite Codes**
<br> There is now a copy icon for each invite code so you can quickly copy a given invite code to the clipboard.

**Account Details**
<br> We added an “Account Details” page to the profile area, allowing users to see all of their Web3 addresses in one place.

**Team Member Stats**
<br> Previously limited to online/offline status and file details, stats now include OS type and application version, aiding IT support and admins. These stats are now cached, so they're visible even if the member is offline and can be accessed  via the Team Member's Information page by clicking their name in the Team List or any chat.

**Invitation Codes For Free Plans**
<br> Invitation codes (aka join codes) are now enabled on the Nomad plan!

**Automatically Detect Invite Code in "Create Zone" Popup**
<br> Some users accidentally enter an invite code in the “Create Zone” popup instead of in the “Join Zone” popup. The app now detects this, and automatically attempts to join a Zone with the invitation code.

**"Quit" Option In Menu**
<br> There is now a “Quit” option to the in-app drop down profile menu when it was previously only accessible from the tray icon.

**Improved Zone Creation Banner** 
<br>The Zone creation/join banner now clears more quickly, allowing the Zone to be used in under a minute.

**Updated Chat Greetings** 
<br> The app now displays a user's chat greeting at the top of the chat history and makes it visible by hovering over the '?' icon by the team member's name.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs, such as updating the 'mark message as unread' feature in chat, removing the 'new message' notification in an active chat so that it now auto-clears, fixing a permissions issue that sometimes prevented devices from sending messages in private chats, allowing systems to access the Invite Codes settings page for the Zone when enabling multiple join codes, and ensuring the selected chat is always used when sharing a file via the OS "share file" feature.
