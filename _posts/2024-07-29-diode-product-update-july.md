The Diode team has been working on great new features and fixes this July for our Diode users (v1.11.14 - 1.11.18).

**Optimized Mobile Start Time**
<br> We improved mobile start time, which was previously slower due to the number of connected Team Members. 

**Improved Zone Creation Banner** 
<br>The Zone creation/join banner now clears more quickly, allowing the Zone to be used in under a minute.

**Updated Chat Greetings** 
<br> The app now displays a user's chat greeting at the top of the chat history and makes it visible by hovering over the '?' icon by the team member's name.


**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs, such as updating the 'mark message as unread' feature in chat, removing the 'new message' notification in an active chat so that it now auto-clears, fixing a permissions issue that sometimes prevented devices from sending messages in private chats, and allowing systems to access the Invite Codes settings page for the Zone when enabling multiple join codes.
