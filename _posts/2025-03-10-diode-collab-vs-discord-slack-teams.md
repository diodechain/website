## Diode Collab vs. Slack, Discord, and Teams

There is nothing more critical to your business than protecting your team and your confidential information - whether it be intellectual property, IT details, personnel data, or financial information. However, most team communication tools, such as Slack, Discord, and Teams, are not end-to-end encrypted, leaving your critical data exposed to the company behind the application.
<br><br>
In this article we explore the case for Diode Collab - a fully end to end encrypted team-oriented chat, file sharing, and remote access tool.

### Why look for a team-oriented secure alternative to Slack, Discord, and Teams?

Slack, Discord, and Teams are great collaboration tools but they weren't designed with E2EE security - none of those tools can ensure your data is not exposed. They are not using “mathematical security” to protect your data - **your data’s confidentiality is a function of their business priorities.**

That means your organization’s data is accessible to:

1.  [The organization who runs the app](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/)
2.  [Governments in the regions where the organization operates](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo)
3.  Hackers when those organizations experience a data breach ([Microsoft Hack](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/microsoft-failings-china/), [Slack Hack](https://www.salesforceben.com/unpacking-the-recent-slack-data-security-breach), [Discord Hack](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/almost-1-million-discord-users-214550087.html))


If you share sensitive information, we argue that you should not trust platforms that don’t guarantee that it is only **you** that holds the encryption keys.

### Why not use a consumer app, like Signal?

Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram, are not well suited for teams - they are “consumer apps” meant for individuals to chat with each other directly, or in informally created groups. This makes it difficult to manage an organization's messaging footprint - many adhoc groups can be created with many different owners.  If a person leaves the organization, a critical group may be orphaned.

Also, these apps require each person to provide a phone number - a piece of PII that an organization should protect their team from exposing.  

Finally, although these apps do use a form of end-to-end encryption, the "group memberships" that define exactly which devices have access to the encrypted data are stored in a traditional server database, which could be tampered with.

Teams need to use a team-oriented chat app that has **better** security guarantees than a consumer app.

<sup>1</sup> Operating on decentralized infrastructure, Diode Collab ensures censorship-resistant communication with no central authority. In contrast, Slack, Discord, and Teams are centralized, giving their companies the power to impose censorship or restrict access. 
<br>
<br>
<sup>2</sup> Users of Diode Collab retain full control over their data through self-hosting or decentralized storage options, while Slack, Discord, and Teams store data on centralized servers, allowing the platforms access to messages and files. 
<br>
<br>
<sup>3</sup> The peer-to-peer network of Diode Collab remains functional in low-bandwidth or disconnected environments, offering resiliency during outages. Other platforms depend on cloud infrastructure, making them vulnerable to disruptions and internet censorship. 
<br>
<br>
<sup>4</sup> With end-to-end encryption and decentralized infrastructure, Diode Collab ensures secure and private communication. The other platforms lack this encryption and rely on centralized servers, increasing vulnerability to censorship. 
<br>
<br>
<sup>5</sup> Diode Collab is tailored for secure communication, supporting sensitive data, remote teams, and decentralized collaboration, while other apps fall short in security and decentralization for business use. 

#### Conclusion:

Collaboration tools should empower teams without compromising security or business continuity. While Slack, Discord, and Teams excel in usability and integration, they leave businesses vulnerable to data access concerns, censorship, and outages.

Diode redefines secure communication by putting ownership back in the hands of organizations with full self-custody and Zero Trust principles. It's decentralized, end-to-end encrypted, and secure architecture ensures teams can collaborate freely - no compromises, no leaks, and nobody looking over your shoulder.
