The Diode team has has published some great exciting new updates during the months of January and February, meeting some big milestones. These have been released in Diode Collab v1.14.2 - 1.15.1.

**Unlimited Member Free Zones**
<br>In partnership with [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/), weâ€™ve made every newly created Zone FREE for an unlimited number of users! We have also retroactively applied the user limit upgrade to all existing Nomad zones. Diode and Moonbeam have a passion for how decentralized technologies can improve security, global access, and collaboration!

**iOS Push Notifications**
<br>Push notifications are now supported in iOS! To enable push notifications on iOS, see [this article](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/enable-push-notifications/).

**Chat Policy**
<br>Zone admins can now control if Members can DM others or view public chats. Members always see Announcements and their private chats, even with public chat visibility off.

**Invites in Zone Selector bar**
<br>Invitations now display as Zone icons at the top of the Zone Selector bar, making them more visible. This update replaces the global 'Invites' page, enhancing invitation visibility and simplifying user engagement.

**Search Global Zones Page**
<br>The global Zones listing page now has a search bar to help people with large numbers of Zones find the one they want to interact with.

**Search Private Channel Members**
<br>The private chat member selection now has a search icon - this makes it easy to add specific team members to a private channel in large zones.

**Notify When New Member Joins a Zone**
<br>A new "New Users" chat channel notifies Admins and Owners when someone joins the Zone, helping manage and welcome users who join via invitation codes.

**File Sync: Off support**
<br>A new file sync mode, "Off," now allows download-only on-demand with no automatic uploads or deletions. Members can choose their sync mode if permitted by Zone policy, while admins and owners always have full control.

**Show Device Details in File History**
<br>The Version History log now shows users which of their devices modified a file, while others see only the user who made the change.


**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including the reduction of duplicate notifications, navigation to unsynced file locations, reduced battery usage on devices, and the improvement of the global page load time.
