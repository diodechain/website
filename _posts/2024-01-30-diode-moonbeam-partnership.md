# Moonbeam and Diode Collaborate on DePIN Platform for Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)

**_Diode partners with Moonbeam to deploy suite of blockchain communication solutions that align with Polkadot founder Gavin Woods’ original vision for Web3_**

SINGAPORE and ROSEBURG, Ore.,  January 30, 2024 –  [Moonbeam Network](https://moonbeam.network), a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications, and [Diode](https://diode.io), the innovation leader in Zero Trust Network Access software, today announced a partnership  to deploy a suite of blockchain-enabled secure communication solutions. 

Diode’s approach uses [DePIN](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/01/29/how-ai-and-depin-will-change-web3/), or “Decentralized Physical Infrastructure,” where blockchain protocols choreograph real-world infrastructure in an autonomous and decentralized manner.  Diode’s massively scalable secure communication platform, which includes solutions for messaging, storage, and web tunneling, helps to bring about the original vision for Web3 created by Gavin Woods, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Polkadot. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently referenced Woods’ vision for Web3, where Ethereum is more than “Bitcoin plus smart contracts,” but becomes a foundation for a “public decentralized shared hard drive.”  Conversely, as Buterin describes, today’s Internet users’ data gets routed through centralized servicers run by entities that have the arbitrary power to monitor, censor, and deplatform.  Diode’s DePIN solution addresses these issues by providing a secure, trustless, and decentralized medium for people and companies to communicate. 

“_In 2023, we started looking for a partner to accelerate our roadmap for deploying high-performance communication infrastructure into new regions. Moonbeam’s shared vision, world-scale distributed infrastructure, amazing team, and access to cross-chain projects make them the perfect partner. Our partnership with Moonbeam helps achieve our vision of empowering the next generation of secure Internet communications,_” said Hans Rempel, CEO of Diode.

Appropriately, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible parachain Moonbeam links the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems. As a truly decentralized network with a DAO governance structure, the Moonbeam project has also maintained the ethos of Web3 at its core.

“_Moonbeam is excited to partner with a technically sophisticated team like Diode. They understand deeply how vital it is for businesses and individuals to transition to ZTNA in order to own and protect their data. Diode’s platform is demonstrable proof that blockchain’s core principles of decentralization and data ownership pave the way for better, more secure user-centric solutions in the real world,_” said Sicco Naets, Head of Ecosystem Development at the Moonbeam Foundation.

[Gartner](https://gartner.com) notes that organizations identify the need to replace VPNs as the primary motivation for adopting ZTNA. Diode’s innovative use of blockchain technology provides a solution that eliminates the single point of failure risk with the trust broker inherent in most other ZTNA and VPN approaches.  This makes it possible to create SaaS applications that are more secure than VPN.  Diode has demonstrated this with the Diode App – a decentralized messaging alternative to Slack and Discord.  

The Diode solution includes the following offerings:

* [Diode App](https://diode.io/solutions/app) – Messaging app that is similar to Slack or Discord, but is more secure than Signal. Teams can share chats, files, notes, wikis and secure Web accesss.
* [Diode CLI](https://diode.io/solutions/cli) – Headless tool that enables edge device connectivity with zero leakage. Used to securely connect assets anywhere in the world, including for IoT/OT data, SSH, websites and server administration.
* [Diode Vault](https://diode.io/solutions/vault) – DePIN solution that ensures 100% availability of team chats, files and assets. Supports backup, time zone-bridging, and Internet/network exit nodes.
* [Diode Network](https://diode.io/solutions/network) – The only ZTNA network anchored in blockchain technology, whose regional DePIN nodes provide communication infrastructure to apps like the Diode App and  others.

By building on Moonbeam and blockchain technology, Diode raises the bar for secure communications.

**About Moonbeam Network**

[Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network) is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications that can access users, assets, and services on any chain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today’s fragmented user experience — unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam’s developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.
