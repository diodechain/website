As concerns for communication security rise globally, the federal government recently issued [new guidelines](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/biden-executive-order-aims-to-protect-americans-sensitive-data-from-china-russia.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail) aimed at protecting Americans' sensitive data, specifically against potential threats from nation state actors. This not only addresses the immediate challenges presented by external threats, but also sets the stage for a system that will manage such issues in an evolving landscape of data exploitation.

Diode can help your organization stay at the forefront of protecting your people and information.  Companies can provide unwavering security for their teams by using Diode to reduce attack surfaces by removing IT and OT interfaces from the public Internet.  This is especially important for executives, field teams, and IT/OT/DevOps teams who daily handle sensitive communications and data.
