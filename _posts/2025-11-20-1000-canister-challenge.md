Diode’s collaboration with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) has introduced always-on, self-custody decentralized infrastructure for private team collaboration. 

Since enabling canisters for all communities in October 2025, over 1,000 Diode Collab Zones are now using canisters for decentralized team collaboration! This milestone highlights the growing adoption of self-custody collaboration for organizations, teams, communities, and families who value privacy.

### Celebrating 1,000 Private Communities with the Internet Computer Protocol!

To celebrate this milestone, Diode is launching the ["1,000 Canister Zone Challenge"](https://x.com/DiodeFoundation/status/1987921334370697292).  

As part of this challenge, users create and expand Diode Collab community Zones - on December 7th, 2025 the top Zones will be selected for rewards.

**Challenge highlights:**

* 📩 To Submit:  Post an X link about the Zone to the Diode Telegram Channel
* ✍️ Stack your Zone's points!:
  - +5 for customizing the Zone icon
  - +10 for customizing the About page
  - +15 for added a Discovery card banner image and blurb
  - +20 for posting on X and tagging @DiodeFoundation and #UseDiode
  - +25 for 2+ daily interactions in your Zone
* 🏆 Top Pick Reward: 500 [DIODE](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/features/is-there-a-diode-token/)
* 🥇🥈🥉  3 Runner-Up Rewards: [1 Disrupt NFT each](https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/disrupt_nft.html)
* ⭐️ Top 10 Zones are featured on the Discover page in Diode Collab 


The campaign turns that 1,000-canister benchmark into a community event, rewarding creative, real-world uses of always-on, self-custody collaboration spaces.


## Diode x ICP: Advancing Decentralized Collaboration

Diode and ICP have teamed up to bring secure, private group collaboration to the next level. By combining Diode’s expertise in direct, encrypted communication with ICP’s innovative blockchain infrastructure, teams can chat and share files with full privacy and control, no central servers required. This collaboration is setting a powerful new standard for everyday digital teamwork, delivering reliability and a sense of full ownership for group spaces.​

As of late 2025, Diode Collab reached a major milestone: over 1,000 unique ICP canisters powering independent self-custody Zones. This achievement highlights the success and rapid growth of decentralized peer-to-peer collaboration, proving that teams are eager for always-on, censorship-resistant platforms where their data remains private and accessible, even when they’re offline. The 1,000 canister mark isn’t just a technical milestone, it’s a sign that decentralized, privacy-first group messaging is thriving and ready for global scale. 

### About ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation, is a public blockchain network designed to run decentralized applications and services at web speed, directly on blockchain-powered infrastructure. ICP replaces traditional cloud services by using a global network of independent data centers and advanced smart contracts to deliver secure, scalable, and censorship-resistant online experiences.​
