## Diode and Moonbeam Partnership

Over the last few years, Diode has been working to deploy secure solutions to individuals and businesses. This effort is driven by the awareness that the Internet is broken due to its major reliance on the third parties that read all of their traffic. In response, many have tried to find solutions in Zero Trust Networking Access (ZTNA) for the security of their information, but have had to rely on a centralised Trust Broker. 

This year, Diode is launching a partnership in collaboration with [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) to align with on the deployment of architecture that provides individuals and businesses with complete data ownership with the solution to centralised Trust Brokers.

Working togehter, Moonbeam and Diode created a unique system of Smart Contracts can be used to eliminate the Trust Broker's reliance on centralization to provide the most secure communications across all applications by mathematically securing the Trust Broker. With this new security solution, third-parties can now communicate without their traffic being read at any point. This opens up a new world of data ownership, secure messaging, private communications, and more autonomy for every individual. With Moonbeam's collaboration, the Diode Network presence will begin to grow and be able to reach users globally so that they have access to this tool.

Moonbeam has united the uses of [Poldakot](https://polkadot.network/), [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) to create a seamless user experience for connected applications, connecting with Diode's idea that accessible communication for anyone, from anywhere, is vital. This has been put into motion with Diode's products (Diode App, Diode CLI, Diode Diode Vault, and Diode Network) and Moonbeam's developer-friendly EVM platform, tool support, and Substrate architecture. Aligned in the vision for complete data ownership, protected teams, and the need for communication, we believe that this partnership will propel secure communications across the globe in a way that will continue the mission to transform the Internet into everyone's prviate network.
