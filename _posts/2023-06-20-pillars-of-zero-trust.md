## The Pillars of the Zero Trust Architecture

Identity/User security 

*   Each user’s identity must be verified for any access to any sort of information (communications, data, etc.) through identification, authentication, and access control policies. This can be done through passwords as well as through multi-factor authentications.

Device security 

*   Identification and authorization with a “system of record” validation is used when devices connect to one another, regardless of if they are user-controlled or autonomous. These validations are used when two devices try to connect to one another.

Data security

*   All security measures are taken in order to protect ones data through devices, applications, and/or networks. This is done through the categorization of the data so that it can be separated from everything/everyone else except for those with access. This process also determines where the data should be stored and is encrypted in the meantime both with in transit or sitting.

Workload security

*   An organization’s workload consists of their applications, digital processes, resources, and programs which are all used for the functionality of the organisation. So, the security of the workload is vital as to prevent unauthorized access that could lead to the tampering or collection of sensitive data.

Automation and Orchestration

*   Automating security processes with Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) enables fast and scalable policy-based actions across the enterprise. SOAR improves security, reduces response times, and integrates security tools like SIEM to manage diverse security systems. It requires defined processes and consistent security policy enforcement in a Zero Trust (ZT) environment to provide proactive command and control.

**Visibility and Analytics**

*   All security processes have to be monitored closely if they are related to access control, segmentation, encryption, or data organization. The process to monitor these components are automated, usually through AI, to detect anomalies to provide insight into user and system behaviours through real-time communications.

Given, there are other pillars of Zero Trust and these particular pillars aren’t end all be all, but these are the ones Diode finds the most foundational for the Zero Trust network. Diode seeks to provide the most secure connections for uploading, downloading, communicating, and storing data all while making these features accessible to everyone. These Zero Trust solutions are built to protect teams.
