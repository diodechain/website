## Diode Collab vs. Slack, Discord, and Teams

There is nothing more critical to your business than protecting your confidential information - whether it be intellectual property, IT details, personnel data, or financial information.  In this article we explore the case for Diode Collab - a fully end to end encrypted team-oriented chat, file sharing, and remote access tool.

### Why look for a secure alternative?

A core tool for team collaboration is team chat.  Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram, are not well suited for teams - they are “consumer apps” meant for individuals to chat with each other or in informally created groups.  

Teams need to use a team-oriented chat app.  Many teams use Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams.  **However, none of these apps use end-to-end encryption (E2EE)!** That means your organization’s data is accessible to:

1.  [The organization who runs the app](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/)
2.  Each regional government where your data is stored, and potentially everywhere the [organization operates](https://diode.io/blog/innovating-zero-trust-for-government)
3.  Hackers when those organizations experience a data breach
    1.  [Microsoft Hack](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/microsoft-failings-china/)
    2.  [Slack Hack](https://www.salesforceben.com/unpacking-the-recent-slack-data-security-breach/)
    3.  [Discord Hack](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/almost-1-million-discord-users-214550087.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKxxWOxitnjOLFZb8qV8Q_obGsYQaWrbmFIIO-KaN0PQQVmPhpYu6oxAkTor-HckLi4rgz2RZZ5q5c7IA4dCHkQ1q9Wfpw-6GjAfgwyX32VZg853_if3M1I_Pt-fO_cmpkxT2bHdC0roiThPX1z0Rg7E9K13oSRK7jxejkf58fn8)

Slack, Discord, and Teams are great collaboration tools but they weren't designed with E2EE security - none of those tools can ensure your data is not exposed. They are not using “mathematical security” to protect your data - **your data’s confidentiality is a function of their business priorities.**

If you share sensitive information, we argue that you should not trust platforms that don’t provide mathematical security for your data.

#### Conclusion:

Collaboration tools should empower teams without compromising security or control. While Slack and Discord excel in usability and integration, they rely on centralized infrastructure, leaving businesses vulnerable to data access concerns, censorship, and outages.

Diode redefines secure communication by putting ownership back in the hands of organizations with full self-custody and Zero Trust principles. Its decentralized, end-to-end encrypted, and secure architecture ensures teams can collaborate freely - no compromises, no leaks, and nobody looking over your shoulder.
