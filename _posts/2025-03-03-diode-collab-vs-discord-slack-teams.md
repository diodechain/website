## Diode Collab vs. Slack, Discord, and Teams

There is nothing more critical to your business than protecting your confidential information - whether it be intellectual property, IT details, personnel data, or financial information.  In this article we explore the case for Diode Collab - a fully end to end encrypted team-oriented chat, file sharing, and remote access tool.

### Why look for a secure alternative?

A core tool for team collaboration is team chat.  Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram, are not well suited for teams - they are “consumer apps” meant for individuals to chat with each other or in informally created groups.  

Teams need to use a team-oriented chat app.  Many teams use Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams.  **However, none of these apps use end-to-end encryption (E2EE)!** That means your organization’s data is accessible to:

1.  [The organization who runs the app](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/)
2.  Each regional government where your data is stored, and potentially everywhere the [organization operates](https://diode.io/blog/innovating-zero-trust-for-government)
3.  Hackers when those organizations experience a data breach
    1.  [Microsoft Hack](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/microsoft-failings-china/)
    2.  [Slack Hack](https://www.salesforceben.com/unpacking-the-recent-slack-data-security-breach/)
    3.  [Discord Hack](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/almost-1-million-discord-users-214550087.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKxxWOxitnjOLFZb8qV8Q_obGsYQaWrbmFIIO-KaN0PQQVmPhpYu6oxAkTor-HckLi4rgz2RZZ5q5c7IA4dCHkQ1q9Wfpw-6GjAfgwyX32VZg853_if3M1I_Pt-fO_cmpkxT2bHdC0roiThPX1z0Rg7E9K13oSRK7jxejkf58fn8)

Slack, Discord, and Teams are great collaboration tools but they weren't designed with E2EE security - none of those tools can ensure your data is not exposed. They are not using “mathematical security” to protect your data - **your data’s confidentiality is a function of their business priorities.**

If you share sensitive information, we argue that you should not trust platforms that don’t provide mathematical security for your data.

### How do they compare to Diode Collab for team collaboration?

<table><tbody><tr><td>Feature</td><td>Slack</td><td>Discord</td><td>Diode</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Decentralization &amp; Censorship Resistance</strong></td><td>Centralized platform controlled by Slack’s policies. Access can be restricted or suspended based on geopolitical regulations or internal decisions.</td><td>Centralized, with the company enforcing bans and censorship on users or entire communities. Subject to platform-imposed restrictions.</td><td>Decentralized infrastructure with no central authority, ensuring communication is resistant to censorship, and no single entity can control or block access.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data Ownership &amp; Control</strong></td><td>Stores all messages and files on centralized servers, giving Slack control over user data. Potential for data analysis and monetization.</td><td>User data stored on centralized servers, allowing Discord access to messages and files, with minimal control for users over data storage.</td><td>Users retain full control of data, with self-hosting options or decentralized storage, ensuring data privacy and preventing third-party access or exploitation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Offline Access &amp; Resiliency</strong></td><td>Dependent on cloud infrastructure, vulnerable to disruptions, outages, or internet censorship, which can affect access to communications.</td><td>Relies on cloud infrastructure, so if the platform goes down, users lose access to essential communication tools and messages.</td><td>Peer-to-peer network ensures communication remains functional even in low-bandwidth or disconnected environments, providing resiliency during outages or cyber threats.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>The Future of Secure Business Communication</strong></td><td>While a popular collaboration tool, its reliance on centralized servers, lack of end-to-end encryption, and vulnerability to censorship make it less future-proof for businesses prioritizing privacy.</td><td>Primarily designed for gaming communities, Discord lacks security features like end-to-end encryption and decentralization, limiting its long-term viability for secure business communication.</td><td>A solution with end-to-end encryption, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. Diode ensures secure, private, and uninterrupted communication, empowering businesses to maintain full control over their data as digital security concerns grow.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use Cases &amp; Best Fit</strong></td><td>Best for workplace collaboration, project management, and team communication. Offers integrations with productivity tools but lacks strong security for sensitive data.</td><td>Designed for gaming and community engagement but often used for casual team collaboration. Lacks enterprise security features, making it unsuitable for confidential business communication.</td><td>Ideal for businesses needing secure, private, and resilient communication. Perfect for teams handling sensitive data, remote teams in restricted environments, and organizations requiring decentralized, censorship-resistant collaboration.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Conclusion:

Collaboration tools should empower teams without compromising security or control. While Slack and Discord excel in usability and integration, they rely on centralized infrastructure, leaving businesses vulnerable to data access concerns, censorship, and outages.

Diode redefines secure communication by putting ownership back in the hands of organizations with full self-custody and Zero Trust principles. Its decentralized, end-to-end encrypted, and secure architecture ensures teams can collaborate freely - no compromises, no leaks, and nobody looking over your shoulder.
