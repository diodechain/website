The Diode team has has published some great new updates for March, making the Diode Collab app even better. These updates have been released in Diode Collab v1.15.2 - 1.15.3.

**Discover Page**
<br>New users land on the "Discover" page, where they can explore and join community Zones. Nomad plan Zones auto-publish at three team members, while paid plans choose, and all Zones offer invite codes for moderated access.

**Chat Reactions**
<br>You can now add a reaction to any chat message! This has been a highly requested feature - enjoy!

**Join Progress**
<br>Newly joined Zones immediately create a spinning icon in the side bar so that the user can follow join progress.

**Initial Arabic Translation**
<br>An initial Arabic translation has been added to the app. Please feel free to contribute to [fully building it out](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/features/languages-on-the-diode-app/)!

**Enable "In Moderation" Invites in Free Zones**
<br>By popular demand, we've enabled In Moderation invite codes in free Zones, allowing communities to vet new members while maintaining security and privacy.

**Increase Chat Attachments to 300MB**
<br>You can now drag and drop files up to 300MB into chats or folders, making it easier for communities to share images and videos in free Zones.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including warning when a member is no longer in a Zone, accidentally duplicated join transactions, and hiding the Zone progress banner on global pages.
