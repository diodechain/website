Diode’s collaboration with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is bringing always-on, self-custody decentralized infrastructure to private teams for peer-to-peer communication and collaboration. By integrating ICP canisters directly into Diode Collab Zones, teams can keep messages and files encrypted and available even when no one is online, without making data to centralized servers or third‑party clouds.

### ICP: Replacing the Traditional Cloud

[ICP](https://internetcomputer.org/) (Internet Computer Protocol) offers a decentralized, secure cloud that leverages blockchain infrastructure, eliminating reliance on centralized servers. It provides scalable, tamperproof smart contracts with fast computation and on-chain data storage. ICP’s architecture ensures data stays secure and available, even offline, while enabling seamless interaction with other blockchains without risky bridges. This approach removes single points of failure, making applications safer, more resilient, and accessible anywhere.

### Diode: Enabling Secure and Decentralized Teams

Diode specializes in simplifying secure communications for organizations. With mounting global complexities over data breaches, Diode eliminates single points of failure and removes vulnerable third parties, so only the intended users ever have access. 

With their secure messaging app, [Diode Collab](https://diode.io/products/collab/), teams can chat, share files, and use web tools privately thanks to direct, encrypted connections—no data gets stored or exposed on traditional servers. Diode’s approach gives groups full control over their information, providing private collaboration and reliable access wherever they work.​

### Diode x ICP: Advancing Decentralized Collaboration

Diode and ICP have teamed up to bring secure, private group collaboration to the next level. By combining Diode’s expertise in direct, encrypted communication with ICP’s innovative blockchain infrastructure, teams can chat and share files with full privacy and control, no central servers required. This collaboration is setting a powerful new standard for everyday digital teamwork, delivering reliability and a sense of full ownership for group spaces.​

As of late 2025, Diode Collab reached a major milestone: over 1,000 unique ICP canisters powering independent self-custody Zones. This achievement highlights the success and rapid growth of decentralized peer-to-peer collaboration, proving that teams are eager for always-on, censorship-resistant platforms where their data remains private and accessible, even when they’re offline. The 1,000 canister mark isn’t just a technical milestone, it’s a sign that decentralized, privacy-first group messaging is thriving and ready for global scale. 

### About ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation, is a public blockchain network designed to run decentralized applications and services at web speed, directly on blockchain-powered infrastructure. ICP replaces traditional cloud services by using a global network of independent data centers and advanced smart contracts to deliver secure, scalable, and censorship-resistant online experiences.​
