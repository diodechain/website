**Messaging Built for Web3**

When communication tools were first built, they were not created for a decentralized world.

Now, as we move forward, more and more like minded people are coming together to build an online world where decentralization, autonomy, privacy, and security _are_ at the core of their communications, giving each person or team the freedom to securely connect with others. At the core of this is the foundation of Web3, where it is built for decentralization, ownership and control of ones' data, and trustless and permissionless access. 

Diode Collab isn't just a messaging app, it's connecting reimagined for the future of Web3 with these three core principles at its center. 

**Decentralization**

Web3 is built on decentralization with no single point of control, running services across a distributed network. 

*Diode Collab Delivers:*
- Local-first by design - Everything runs directly on your devices, with no dependency on cloud servers or centralized infrastructure.
- Peer-to-peer collaboration - Teams connect through secure tunnels using end-to-end encryption, no intermediaries.
- Censorship-resistant - Functions reliably in unstable environments or during internet restrictions, making it ideal for high-risk or globally distributed teams.

You run your own infrastructure with no backdoors, no centralized authorities, and no data hosting dependencies. 

**Ownership and Control**

Web3 is centered around the concept of ["read, write, own"](https://limeacademy.tech/what-are-the-core-principles-of-web3/) where people don't just use platforms, but rather own their own identities, data, and assets. 

*Diode Collab Delivers:*
- Self custody everything - Users retain full control over their messages, files, credentials, and activity. Nothing is stored or managed by a third party.
- No PII - No phone numbers, emails, or any other personally identifiable information needd to use.
- Blockchain-based access - Identity and access are handled with decentralized credentials, putting the user (not a server) in charge of who gets in.

Only you have full access to your data and what information you use to be on Diode Collab, nobody can access it, not even Diode. 

**Trustless and Permissionless Access**

One of the biggest shifts for Web3 is that people don't have to place trust in a company as a whole to keep information secure, but rather the security is built so that the technology itself without needing to rely on a platform to manage identity or protect data.  

*Diode Collab Delivers:*
- Zero Trust by design — Every access request is cryptographically verified with no implicit trust or central authority.
- Permissionless collaboration — Anyone can create or join Zones without gatekeepers, admins, or IT provisioning.
- Works anywhere — From high-security environments to limited-connectivity regions, Diode Collab operates without third-party infrastructure.
  
With Diode Collab, trust is something that’s already built in.

**Diode Collab Leading the Future of Web3 Secure Communications**

Diode Collab is built by a team wanting to help you protect your team’s data by combining the core principles of Web3's decentralization, ownership, and trustless security to deliver privacy, control, and resilience in how you communicate and collaborate.
