**Messaging Built for Web3**

When communication tools were first built, they were not created for a world in which your data lived in cloud environments beyond your control.  They were built for a more innocent time when successful communication was the ends, instead of the means to acquire your information.

As the Internet and cloud infrastructure has advanced to meet demand, the underlying technology services, and most of the widely used communication apps, have consolidated the control and storage of sensitive data for billions of people.  This has created perverse business incentives and increasingly dramatic data breaches.

In response, more and more like minded people are coming together to leverage decentralized technologies so that autonomy, privacy, and resilience are an inherent part of their communication tools. The core of decentralization is the consensus model of Web3 which allows Internet infrastructure to autonomously operate with no central point of failure, and no inherent "account" model requiring apriori knowledge of participants (i.e. "permissionless").  

Diode is the leading provider of permissionless secure communication.  The Diode Network provides a zero trust (fine grained permissions) communication network that can be rapidly integrated by SaaS applications so that apps can be deployed that exhibit the desired autonomy, privacy, and resilience.

Diode Collab is built on the Diode Network - it is the Web3 messaging app for teams.  

It reimagines collaboration with the three core principles at its center: decentralization, data ownership, and permissionless security.

**Decentralization**

Decentralization means no single point of control or failure.

*Diode Collab:*
- Local-first - Everything runs directly on your devices, with no dependency on cloud servers or centralized network infrastructure.
- Peer-to-peer collaboration - Teams connect through secure tunnels using end-to-end encryption, no intermediaries.
- Censorship-resistant - The system functions reliably in sensitive environments and during Internet restrictions, making it ideal for high-risk or globally distributed teams.

With Diode Collab, your devices are both the app and the infrastructure.  No backdoors, no centralized authorities, and no data hosting dependencies. 

**Data Ownership**

Data Ownership can be visualized by the progression of ["read, write, own"](https://limeacademy.tech/what-are-the-core-principles-of-web3/).  People don't just use platforms, but rather they own their own identities, data, and assets. 

*Diode Collab:*
- Self custody - Users retain full control over their messages, files, credentials, and activity. Nothing is stored or managed by a third party.
- No PII required - No phone numbers, emails, or any other personally identifiable information is collected.
- Pseudoanonymous identities - Identity and access are delivered via decentralized credentials, putting the user (not a server) in charge of their devices and their online identity.

With Diode Collab, only you have full access to your data and what information you use to communicate with.  

**Permissionless Security**

Permissionless Security means you don't need to trust a company's business priorities will be sufficient to keep your information secure.  Your self-custodial credentials are the only thing you need to manage identity and protect data.  

*Diode Collab:*
- Zero Trust by design — Every access request is cryptographically verified with no implicit trust or central authority.
- Permissionless collaboration — Anyone can create or join Zones without gatekeepers, admins, or IT provisioning.
- Works anywhere — From high-security environments to limited-connectivity regions, Diode Collab operates without third-party infrastructure.
  
With Diode Collab, trust is something that’s already built in.

**Diode Collab is leading the future of Web3 Secure Communication**

Diode Collab is built by a team that wants to help protect your organization's information assets. Diode Collab delivers the autonomy, privacy, and resilience you need for the next generation of value creation.
