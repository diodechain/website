## Top 3 Diode Collab Use Cases

### Personal & Individual Use

**Key Needs:**

*   Protecting personal information such as passwords, documents, or family photos

*   Secure chatting and collaboration
*   Easy access to information without compromising privacy

**Diode Collab:**

*   **Secure Storage and Sharing:** Personal data never passes through centralized server and everything is [end-to-end encrypted](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/how-it-works/).  
*   **No Identifiable Information:** [No email or phone numbers](https://diode.io/blog/messaging-app-without-a-phone-number) are needed to use Diode Collab. Access is based on blockchain-based identity, giving the user full control. 
*   **Access Across Devices:** Information can be synced securely [across devices](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/linked-devices/) without relying on third parties.
*   **Built-In Tools:** Create [notes](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/features/take-secure-notes-with-diode-drive/), share documents, or create/upload files
*   **Secure Communication:** Create group channels with friends and family to [chat](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/create-a-group-chat/).
