The Diode team has been working hard at updates and has published some great new features during the month of October. These have been released in Diode Collab v1.13.8 - 1.13.9.

**HTML Previewer**
<br>HTML files can now be previewed in full-screen mode. Local Bookmarks for HTML files can also be set to open in full-screen via the Bookmark settings. See how it works: [Loom Video](https://www.loom.com/share/506b3e1c11c2450d9e52716e21ee6452).

**Scrolling for Account List**
<br>The account list in the profile menu is now scrollable. 

**Message Character Limit**
<br>Chat messages are limited to 2,000 characters but there is now a character counter helps you track message length, and a warning appears if you reach the limit.

**Restart Option**
<br>The app can now be restarted via a menu option when clicking the taskbar icon.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs such as improving the image cropper, improving the archive of channels, and the issue that deleted drafted messages.
