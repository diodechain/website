**Diode Collab: Secure Collaboration, Redefined**

After three years of development, we're excited to launch a major update to Diode Collab: our next-gen collaboration suite designed for seamless, secure teamwork.

With chat, file sharing, note-taking, and remote access, Diode Collab ensures teams stay connected while maintaining full data self-custody. For example, if your team works remotely but needs secure access to an on-premises GitLab instance, Diode Collab provides easy, encrypted access-without relying on third parties.

**What is Full Self-Custody?**

Full self-custody means no third-party access to your data. Originating from Web3 and crypto, it ensures that only you hold the keys-just like owning Bitcoin. Diode applies this to communication and collaboration, giving organizations sole control over their data while keeping it globally accessible and always available. Security is mathematically guaranteed by blockchain, ensuring that only you can access, delete, and manage your data-without relying on third parties.

**Simplicity and Cost Efficiency**

Diode Collab simplifies security with cryptographic keys instead of passwords, making access safer and more reliable. It also cuts costs by replacing multiple tools-cloud storage, communication, and VPNs-with one solution. Running on a decentralized network, it eliminates server and maintenance expenses, directly benefitting users with the reduced costs.

**Reliability and Uptime**

Another major advantage is increased uptime. Blockchains, by their nature, have little to no downtime. Compare this with cloud providers or self-hosted on-premise solutions, which can experience outages due to server failures or regional catastrophes like storms or tornadoes. With a chain-based system like Diode Collab, your data remains accessible no matter what.

**Example of Diode Collab**

By taking a look at the app, you can easily create a Zone and can edit it to your liking. Within your Zone, you can take notes, share them with a team, chat, and exchange documents and files—all within a fully self-custodied environment.

**Introducing Zone Availability Canisters**

ICP and Diode Canisters enable seamless messaging in Diode Collab. When you send a message, it’s stored on your device-but what if you go offline before the recipient comes online?

Zone Availability Canisters, hosted on the ICP blockchain, solve this by ensuring message syncing. Here’s how it works:

1.  **Diode Collab creates a canister** through a factory.
2.  **The factory generates a child canister**, one per organizational Zone.
3.  **The canister is fully owned by the organization**, not Diode.
4.  **A child history mechanism refills canisters with cycles** (ICP’s resource allocation system).
5.  **The canister syncs messages**, so users can retrieve them even if others are offline.

All data is encrypted, ensuring privacy and security. The best part? Organizations fully control their canisters, and the source code is open for auditing on GitHub.
