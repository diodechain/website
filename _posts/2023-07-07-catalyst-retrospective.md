Diode was honored to be selected as the emerging Zero Trust communications company to participate in the Defensive Cyber Operations for Space cohort program, held at the [Catalyst Campus for Technology and Innovation](https://catalystcampus.org/) (CCTI) in Colorado Springs, CO.  The Catalyst program is a partnership between the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/) (AFRL) and CCTI, and its objective is to integrate nontraditional tech companies into the national security ecosystem.  [Hans and Eric](/about) from Diode attended the program and .

As a primarily commercially-focused organization, Diode sensed there was  Here were some of the takeaways from the program:


HIgh level takeaway: Awesome fit, Diode is aweseom, engaging and investing 


#1 - Zero Trust is driving investment

Required from every agency

#2 - Taking advantage of Zero Trust benefits is not always just a technical challenge

Legacy OT, comms, training, tools

#3 - Partnerships are critical

Cohort, buyers, primes, providers, consortiums, regional PTACS


Lots of resources available - maybe too many

Providing commercial technology in a way that the US government can adopt or adapt it is non-trivial.  There are a myriad of acronyms, systems, accounts, formats, roles, and programs related to helping commercial businesses supply technologies and services to the government.  However, despite the desire for collaboration on both sides, and perhaps due to it, knowing how to engage is half the battle.

The program provided content on a wide variety of topics that helped to disambiguate the resources, scope the engagement investment/return, and understand the different buyer models.  Diode left the program with a mini-MBA in government engagement and was equipped to scope opportunities, manage timeline and budget expectations, and employ partnership tactics for engagement.

#2 - Practical Engagement Paths

Diode was able to identify a few practical engagement paths during the program and found three paths to be immediately actionable: 

Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) - DIU programs use a rapid engagement model that is optimized for placing successful commercial technologies into funded government buyers. DIU programs also use an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) which can make them more flexible with respect to timing, compliance, and intellectual property topics.  There are also other alternative contract vehicles (e.g. https://space-enterprise.org/, https://www.tradewindai.com/, others) doing similar things as DIU.

Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) - there are hundreds of SBIR programs available to apply to that range from $50k (small Phase I) to >$1M (possible in a direct-to-Phase II).  These take some time to apply to, but there is a significant ecosystem that is built to help a business succeed with an SBIR program.

Partnerships - many organzations already have contracts to deploy significant capabilities and can create better impact by partnering with a business focused on a specific problem/solution set.

#3 - The Other Cohort Companies

The Catalyst program coordinators and advisors did a great job selecting other emerging companies who are leading their field.  Working and collaborating with leaders from these organizations was truly a case of “iron sharpens iron” and the partnerships that were created have the potential of innovating disruptive capabilities for government and commercial sectors.
