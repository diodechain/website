## Diode Product Update - December 2023

We hope everyone is having an awesome December - our development team has been busy improving our products for you all.

Here is a recap of the updates weâ€™ve released in the last month (1.8.12 - 1.8.18):

*   **Full Web3 and Web2 Proxy** We made a decision to expose a full tunneled proxy interface on port 57861. The app natively uses this proxy to connect to Web3 and Web2 Proxy bookmarks, and you can also configure an external browser to use this to protect your browsing sessions or access web3 resources for anywhere in the world.
*   **Network Administration** The app now allows the Zone owner to manage certain aspects of the underlying Diode Network so that permissions can be modified for access to IT equipment, machines, and servers.
*   **Simplify File Preview** We put all the file meta information / details behind a little information icon instead of at the bottom of the preview. This cleans up the file previews.
*   **Logging Function** You can now access a local debug log of your device from the Profile menu under Operations. Since Diode doesn't capture information from your device, this is helpful if you have a support request.
*   **MD Editor Updates** We now support code blocks in the MD editor, and no longer truncate previews of long files.
*   **Chat Updates** We cleaned up a number of chat edge cases (like chat mention sort order) and finally support deleting messages!
*   **Archive channels** You can now archive a chat channel so that you can keep its history around without taking up space in the app for your team or for your plan entitlements.
*   **PIN Code Protection** You can now add a PIN code to your profile so that Diode cannot be loaded without first entering the PIN code. This is important if you may be in a situation in which you cannot be sure of the physical security of your device.
*   **Many bug fixes and improvements** The team released over 100 bug fixes and improvements to the app that may not be visible in your everyday usage. Things like Linux media file previews, aligning nickname/username usage, and making updates more performant.
