The Diode team has been working hard to transform the Internet into everyone's private network! Here are some of the updates that were made this May for Diode (v1.11.10 - 1.11.13).

**Share Files to Folder or Chat**
<br> Users can now use the OS "share" function to share a file to a chat or a folder location when previously this function was only supported a folder location.

**Chat Greeting** 
<br>Admins have the option to create a chat greeting per Zone so that the new members joining the Zone can get an automatic greeting when the admin's name is selected to chat with for friendly engagement. 

**Multiple Invite Codes** 
<br>Invitation codes can now invite one or more Diode users to be any role type in a Zone along with an expiration date and limit to the amount of times an invite code can be sent. 

**Organized Plan Entitlements for "Read Only" Users** 
<br>Separate entitlements are now shown separately on the Zone settings Plan page and are also treated differentlyin the various add user and invitation code configuration areas.
  

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs such as removing the ability to go back to a file that no longer exists, handling delayed block state updates that caused occasional missed Zone settings, elminating a condition that created malformed databases for new Zones, a quicker way to join Zone conversations or private chats...
