July brought a new round of improvements to the Diode Collab app - the following updates are live in versions v1.17.10 to v1.17.13!

**ICP Support for Join & Chat Attachments**
<br>Diode now uses Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canisters and vetKeys to enable secure Zone joining and chat attachment syncing, even when no existing members are online, by validating membership through ChainFusion and providing decryption keys through the Zone smart contract.  

**"View All" Conversations**
<br>A “View all conversations” link now appears in DMs, letting you see all chats with a contact across Zones and jump to the right one.

**Visible Zone Owner**
<br>The Discover page Zone cards now show the Zone owner’s username so interested members have more context on the Zone.

**Fast Join if Zone Has a Canister**
<br>The time to join a Zone will be reliably much faster (order of seconds) if a Zone has been configured with an Internet Computer Protocol Canister.

**Shuffle Top Performing Nodes Faster**
<br>Regional nodes are now shuffled every 60 seconds, keeping the top five performers to ensure optimal connections and seamless fail overs.

**Auto-Download Chat Files on View**
<br>When a user clicks on a chat file to view it, the sync/download process of the file is now automatically started.

**Word Doc Icon**
<br>Word docs now show an icon in the preview page instead of “No preview or settings available for this file type.”

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including fixing PIN issues, accidental pause of filing syncing, push notifications only be available to members accepted to a Zone, and the quicker validation of join codes.
