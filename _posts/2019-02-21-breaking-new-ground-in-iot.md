After months of incubation we're excited to start talking about our new, we believe groundbreaking, initiative: Diode<sup>SM</sup> Incubating within [Exosite](https://exosite.com), we've been working hard to fix some of the fundamental shortcomings of PKI that are underlying 99% of all Internet communication today.

For the first time now it becomes practical, with Diode, to use blockchain technology to eradicate the issues with PKI for IoT devices.  Our technologies work even on low-end embedded devices and increase the security of existing and new solutions manyfold. Follow us here on the journey in the weeks to come as we chart a new course for IoT Device security!
