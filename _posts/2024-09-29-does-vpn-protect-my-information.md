When it comes to privacy, many people turn to VPNs for protection of their information and data. Unfortunately, there are several reasons why this may not be the case, highlighting the shortcomings of traditional VPNs. 

Diode addresses each of these main issues.

### Four Issues With VPN Not Protecting Your Information:

**VPN Servers Aren’t Private**

In January of 2024, [a free VPN exposed](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacyhub/chinese_vpn_leaks_user_data/) the IP dresses, IDs, domain names of websites visited, and app usage timestamps of 5.7 billion data entries after a breach. If VPNs didn't store such sensitive data in the first place and know what sites you look at and who you are, there would be nothing to leak in the event of a breach. Not to mention that, if your VPN has your billing info, they aren’t a privacy tool. 

**VPN is Easy to Detect**

When your device is using a VPN, it is easy to detect from observing the network the computer is on. Websites, apps, and ISPs do this for a [variety of different reasons](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vpn-blocker) such as copyright protection, network security, government censorship, network load management, and so on. If using VPN is a “red flag” in your region, just the use of the VPN could create undesirable attention as well as block teams from being able to access necessary sites or tools they need while traveling.

**VPN “takes over” Your Device**

When you run a VPN, your computer [slows as all Internet traffic](https://surfshark.com/blog/do-vpns-slow-down-internet#:~:text=A%20VPN%20will%20slow%20down,that%20bandwidth%20for%20encryption%20purposes.) routes through the VPN. People often turn it off because of this and forget to turn it back on, leading to unintentional data leaks and potential breaches. This also exposes bugs in network software that can compromise the VPN itself. 

[In early 2024](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/us-state-government-network-breached.html), attackers exploited an inactive admin account without multi-factor authentication to access a government network through a VPN, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Enterprise VPN Needs Static IPs or Vulnerable Trust Brokers**

If you want to create a VPN connection to an office or piece of machinery or server, you have to have a static IP address, or use a “[trust broker](https://diode.io/blog/trust-broker-security#:~:text=Trust%20Brokers%20Make%20Zero%20Trust,who%20would%20like%20to%20communicate.)” VPN network whose servers could themselves be subject to breach or untrustworthy behavior. These severs, or trust brokers, are what [hackers typically target](https://cybersecuritynews.com/post-exploitation-tactics-on-ivanti-fortigate-vpn-servers-hack/) when trying to gain access to the information in VPNs. 

Not to mention the [difficulties there are](https://www.remote.it/resources/top-ten-vpn-struggles) in setting up enterprise VPNs such as the proper protocol to set up firewalls, configuring user credentials, and the extra layer of encryption that slows down connection and possibly negatively impact a company’s productivity.  

### Diode fixes all four.

**Completely Private**

Diode allows you, or your trusted IT provider, to run your own VPN exit node in your home, your office, or other secure location.  Only the “exit node” provider can tell what sites you are looking at. It takes a minute to setup and run a Diode exit node. Diode is democratizing VPN and putting the “private” back in VPN, creating “ZTN” (Zero Trust Network). 

**Undetectable**

Since Diode lets you run your ZTN exit node from “home," the IP address detected by sites will reflect the exit node's location, not your physical location. This makes ZTN usage undetectable to regions that block certain sites or tools.

**Complete Device Functionality**

The Diode App runs like any regular application on any device, without interfering with your internet connection. The exit node operates from the [App’s bookmarks](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/features/diode-bookmarks/) and load through the [Brave search engine](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/why-does-the-diode-app-use-the-brave-browser-for-some-bookmarks/), without interrupting any traffic or slowing down your device. 

**Easy and Secure**

Diode enables any server, equipment, facility, or computer to connect via direct ZTN tunnels, where their Web3 address serves as their “static IP” address, allowing access from anywhere. Unlike other VPN networks, it eliminates the vulnerabilities or “just trust me.” [Diode nodes](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/features/lite-nodes-vs-full-nodes/) use blockchain-secured smart contract anchoring, ensuring that no corrupt IT admin, social engineering attack, or breached trust broker can compromise the network's security. The trust broker is also [completely mathematically secured](https://diode.io/blog/trust-broker-security#:~:text=Trust%20Brokers%20Make%20Zero%20Trust,who%20would%20like%20to%20communicate.), leaving no room for man-in-the-middle attacks via physical or cyber vulnerabilities.

Finally, [anyone can set it up](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/). The ease of use and guaranteed security make ZTN a perfect alternative for those looking to replace VPNs or seeking a secure, hassle-free setup to protect their team or device.
