As concerns for communication security rise globally, the federal government recently issued [new guidelines](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/biden-executive-order-aims-to-protect-americans-sensitive-data-from-china-russia.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail) aimed at protecting Americans' sensitive data, specifically against potential threats from nation state actors. 

This executive order not only addresses the immediate challenges presented by external threats, but also sets the stage for a system that will manage such issues in an evolving landscape of data exploitation.

Diode can help protect executives, field teams, and IT/OT/DevOps teams who daily handle sensitive communications and data.  With Diode, your organization can stay at the forefront of protecting your people and information.  You can quickly increase security for your teams by removing IT and OT interfaces from the public Internet, thereby reducing or eliminating attack surfaces.
