### Replacing VPNs for International Companies and NGOs

Diode’s tunneling capability secures access to common tools like Microsoft Teams or Google Workspace for international companies and NGOs. This capability replaces the need for enterprise VPNs, reducing cost and IT department configuration, while allowing precise and safe access to organizational resources in all regions of the world.

Diode offers a VPN-like capability by employing a secure tunneling method that is specifically designed for easy user access to team platforms while significantly increasing security measures. Recognizing the susceptibility of observation of session data, Diode's solution enables team members to protect sensitive corporate information by bookmarking the organizational links within their Diode zone. These bookmarks launch the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/?mtm_source=www.google.com&mtm_medium=cpc&mtm_campaign=brand&mtm_content=brave_browser&ref=BOW954&gclid=CjwKCAiA8NKtBhBtEiwAq5aX2KfaRim5LRG-KsnWj3hz1bT5mxOTVxsmfQ-foMp90pb6AXZedrSkwRoC_zYQAvD_BwE) in a secure tunnel.  In this way, Diode integrates with existing collaborative settings, organizational work environments, CRMs, critical dashboards and tools around the world.  Taking secure tunneling a step further, Diode empowers organizations to [configure self-host critical resources](https://support.diode.io/article/6pctb40wj8-configure-a-custom-domain-for-diode) off the public internet through Web3 bookmarks. 

While Diode's feature benefit organizations anywhere seeking security solutions for financial information and personal identifiable information (PII), the secure tunneling is especially beneficial for international teams.  Diode's tool enables secure tunneling for teams working across different geographic locations, ensuring that IP addresses and data remain confidential during transmission.  

The global extension of resources by Diode not only ensures security but also offers a user-friendly experience surpassing costly traditional enterprise VPNs or off-the-shelf consumer VPNs. By prioritizing ease of use and comprehensive protection, Diode is a reliable solution for organizations wanting to safeguard their intellectual property and sensitive data while opperating and collaborating internationally.
