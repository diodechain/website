The Diode Collab app made strong improvements throughout November, delivering valuable improvements across versions v1.17.28 through v1.18.7.

**Private Drives**
<br> Private Drives lets teams create multiple permission-based drives inside one Zone, each with its own storage and settings, so organizations can give members access only to what they need and consolidate collaboration into a single Zone.

**Faster Zone Settings & Mobile File Sync**
<br>Because mobile devices (especially Android) have slower disk performance, joining large or multiple Zones could take a long time, but improved database performance now lets devices complete syncing smoothly even with thousands of files.

**Zone Switching Speed**
<br>The time to switch between Zones was improved in certain use cases.

**Backup Summary in Zone Header**
<br>Devices with File Backup enabled now see a backup icon in the Zone header, giving a clear overview of backup status across all Drives.

**ICP File System Storage GA**
<br>Always-on file system storage is now generally available, providing a 100MB sync cache so recently modified or transferred files can still be shared even when no other users are online (with a 10MB max per file).

**Lower Power & Memory with New Connection Pool**
<br>This release introduces a major P2P connection pool update that replaces the old star-style connections with a token-ring approach, boosting performance and reducing resource usage—especially in large Zones with over 500 users.

**Tooltip to Show Chat Reaction Participants**
<br>Zone Admins and Owners can now hover over chat reactions to see which members reacted, making it easier to confirm participation.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including making a smoother load time for the Discover page, online/offline indicator improvements, Zones appearing quickly after joining, and improving the performance of Zone checks.
