When we talk on the phone, our experience is one of directly calling another person - we no longer have to interact with switchboards, operators, and party lines. Those are things of the past, no longer necessary in today’s directly connected world.

**Why isn’t file sharing like calling someone on the phone - a direct connection without the involvement of third parties?**

Diode Drive makes this possible - it allows you to share files directly from your computer straight to another computer or device!

Cloud-based file sharing applications, like Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, are today playing the role of the telephone operator in file sharing and collaboration - the third party in between.  To take the analogy a step further, [many of these third-parties also “listen in” on the information in your files](https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-does-big-tech-know-about-you-basically-everything).  _To make matters worse, their business models are often constructed around their ability to listen in!_
 
**What if you could share a file directly with another person without the privacy concerns of third parties?**
 
With Diode Drive any file, no matter the size, can both be shared and synchronized with the people you choose - all without ever uploading to the cloud.
