The Diode team rolled out some great updates in May, making the Diode Collab app even better. You’ll find these improvements in versions v1.16.1 - 1.17.4.

**Faster Boot Times**
<br>App startup is much quicker, especially on desktop. Android improved too, but more updates are coming.

**Smoother Zone Switching**
<br> Switching between Zones, especially large ones, is now faster and more seamless.

**Faster Discover Page**
<br>Community cards now load much quicker on the Discover page.

**Improved Linked Devicess**
<br>Zone invites are no longer auto-accepted across linked devices—you choose what to join.

**Zone Publication Banners**
<br>Admins now see a banner when their Zone is published to the Discovery page.

**Bots Now Auto 2-Way Sync**
<br>Bots automatically switch to 2-way sync for easier headless management.

**OS Folder Access**
<br>Even unsynced folders can now be opened in your OS file explorer.

**Username Limit**
<br>Usernames are now limited to 40 characters during signup.

**Smarter Zone Join**
<br>The app now checks your internet connection before and during Zone joins, with clearer offline messaging.

**Ordered File Transfers**
<br>File transfers are now shown by completion time instead of Zone name.


**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including improving all-team selection in chat, iOS unlinking Zones, web link share loading, and text overlapping the search bar.
