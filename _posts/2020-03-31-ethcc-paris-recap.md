This month, the Diode team spent a week in Paris for [EthCC 3](https://ethcc.io/) event. Here is a recap of some of the most interesting things we have seen.

Hundreds of developers, researchers, investors, and aspiring founders gathered in Paris earlier this month for the third annual [Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC)](https://ethcc.io/index.html). Held in the 5th arrondissement of Paris on March 3-5, CTO [Dominic Letz](https://twitter.com/DominicLetz) and team members were able to connect globally at the forefront of blockchain technology.

At “ETH2REAL WORKSHOP,” a special workshop session curated by Ethereum Foundation Research team, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin quickly decided to improvise on his presentation with paper and pen in front of a whiteboard in response to technical difficulties of a projector. The discussions were as effective as it ought to be; the audience were able to engage and understand the hard problems at stake with Vitalik’s professor-like lecturing style.

Abbey Titcomb from the [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) team gave a presentation about decentralized code collaboration. (Watch Abbey's presentation on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/wE3BxeBdvzs](https://youtu.be/wE3BxeBdvzs)) It was interesting to hear the speaker talked about [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [peer-to-peer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer), her thoughts on open source contributing and collaborating in general, as well as some of the design approaches for decentralized code collaboration. It seems that Abbey has a lot of things going on. Most recently, she was the moderator and organizer of [Sustain Web3 Summit event](/diode/Highlights-of-SustainWeb3-Event-in-Denver-Colorado-20060/) which took place in Denver, Colorado during [EthDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) week in mid February.

Another interesting presentation was delivered by Mikerah from Toronto, Canada. She talked about validator privacy issues in Eth 2.0. Watch the presentation on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/WC0GPPZ-qVg](https://youtu.be/WC0GPPZ-qVg) Mikerah discussed this topic in detail in a recent research post “[Exploring a hybrid networking architecture for improved privacy in ETH2.0](https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-a-hybrid-networking-architecture-for-improved-validator-privacy-in-eth2-0/7207)”.

Unfortunately, we later learned that at least 18 EthCC attendees tested positive for COVID-19. Our team members who went to the EthCC event did a 14-day home quarantine right after. We hope you all stay safe and stay healthy!
