As Diode grows, so does the community within [Diode Foundation](https://diode.foundation/docs/about.html). This growth is driven in part by those who host Relay Nodes-individual points of presence (DePIN nodes) within the Diode Network.

These nodes help connect secure communications between devices, securely relaying information or directly connecting devices. The more people who host these nodes in different regions, the more secure regional communications become available to a variety of devices.

By hosting a node, people contribute to a more secure and decentralized Internet, turning the Internet into everyone's private network, one Node at a time. Additionally, hosts earn rewards based on the bandwidth their Node supplies to others, creating mutual benefits for all those in the hosting process.

As more nodes come online, [the Diode team and others can see as 'lights](https://diode.io/network/#/)’ appear across the globe, creating a visual representation of the collective effort towards a more secure Internet. 

To be a part of this change, [see here](https://diode.foundation/docs/diode_network.html) to read more about the [Diode Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_-r1ARlivs&feature=youtu.be), [Relay Nodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVyptO7prf0&feature=youtu.be), [software needed](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/), and usage of the Network. If you would like to host your own node, you can watch a video on how to set it up [here](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/). 

Diode aims for nodes to be hosted in every region, enabling people worldwide to securely access their local networks. Join us in our pursuit of a more secure Internet!
