We are excited to share that the leading Web3 ZTNA, the Diode Network, exceeded 100 global points of presence in late January 2025!   

You can see them [here on the network map](https://diode.io/network/#/).

This growth is driven by many [Diode Foundation](https://diode.foundation/docs/about.html) ecosystem contributors who host one or more individual Relay Nodes (DePIN nodes), each contributing a regional access/presence point to the Diode Network.

Each node provides a regional access point for secure communications.  Any client (device/user/system) in the vicinity of the node will discover the node and begin to use it to securely communicate with other regional, or remote, systems. The more people who host these nodes in different regions, the more performant and secure regional communications become for every type of device in the region.

As people contribute to the Diode Network, the result is a more secure and decentralized Internet - the Internet becomes everyone's private network - one node at a time!  As more nodes come online, [the nodes can be seen on the network map as 'lights](https://diode.io/network/#/)’ spread across the globe.  This is a wonderful visual representation of the community's collective effort towards a more secure Internet. 

In addition to contributing to the noble (and accessible!) goal of a more secure Internet, node runners earn rewards based on the bandwidth their node supplies to sponsored applications, creating mutual benefits for all those in the hosting process.

To be part of this change, try [hosting a node in three steps](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/) - it can take less than five minutes! 

The Diode Foundation's mission is to deploy nodes into every useful region, enabling people worldwide to securely access their local networks. Join us in our pursuit of a more secure Internet!
