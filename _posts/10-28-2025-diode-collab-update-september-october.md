**Dismiss Desktop OS Notifications Automatically**
<br>OS notifications on desktop are now dismissed automatically as soon as the message has been read.

**Support Additional Partner Brands**
<br>Free zones with partner sponsors now show the sponsorâ€™s logo in the Quick Access bar and in the Discover page card.

**Download Que Priority**
<br>The file download queue algorithm has been improved to help Zones complete sync, especially on resource constrained devices.
