The Diode Collab app saw great progress throughout September and October, with impactful updates in versions v1.17.21 to v1.17.27 as the team continues advancing a broader set of major developments in upcoming versions that are soon to be released.

**Enable ICP Canisters on All Zones**
<br> As of 1.17.23, all Zones now include an ICP Canister by default, bringing always-on self-custody benefits to every Zone. Learn more [here](https://diode.io/blog/diode-self-custody).

**Dismiss Desktop OS Notifications Automatically**
<br>OS notifications on desktop are now dismissed automatically as soon as the message has been read.

**Support Additional Partner Brands**
<br>Free zones with partner sponsors now show the sponsor’s logo in the Quick Access bar and in the Discover page card.

**Download Que Priority**
<br>The file download queue algorithm has been improved to help Zones complete sync, especially on resource constrained devices.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs including Web link creation fixes, stuck Zone syncing, certain OS issues, and Web sharing occasionally requiring an App restart.
