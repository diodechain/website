## The Cost of Data Breaches

As the web develops and tech becomes more accessible, more and more people are using the tools that are provided to store, upload, and send their data. However, as the online world is expanding, it is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses, individuals, and corporations to ensure that their sensitive data is completely secure. So, in order to protect this information, it is crucial to first understand the cost of a data breach. 

In the year between 2020 and 2021, there was a 10% increase in the average total cost of a breach, which is the largest single year cost increase that has occurred in the last seven years. Within this single year, this 10% increase made the breach cost rise from $3.86 million to $4.24 million, making the current cost the highest it had ever been in history. Then, in 2022, this number rose again with a 2.6% increase to $4.35 million meaning that, in total, the cost average climbed 12.7% since 2020. 

Since 2021, there has been a growth rate of 41% of ransomware attacks. The average rate of these breaches was only 7.8% in 2021 but then proceeded to rise to 11% by 2022 with a cost of $4.54 million, which is only slightly higher than the overall cost of a data breach at $4.35 million. 

This cost is not just affecting certain businesses either. A total of 83% of organizations have experienced more than one data breach with only 17% claiming it was their first. As a result of the costs that come with the breaches, around 60% of companies have said that that they have been forced to increase the price of their services or products. 

Out of all the different types of data breaches, 44% of them are related to customer personally identifiable information (PII) and the loss of their records. This type of breach is also the most costly record type at $180 per lost or stolen record. Business email compromise (BEC) only results in 4% of breaches, but has the highest average cost at $5.01 million. Then, phishing is averaged at $4.65 million, malicious insiders at $4.61 million, social engineering at $4.47 million, and lastly, compromised credentials at $4.37 million. 

The average number of days it takes for a data breach to be identified and contained is 287. Unfortunately, the longer it takes to contain, the more costly the breach is. Breaches that take longer than 200 days to identify and contain cost around $4.87 million while ones that take less than 200 ays cost $3.61 million.

Where zero trust companies were involved, there was a reduction in the average cost of data breaches. Without the use of zero trust, the average cost of a breach is $5.04 million compared to the $3.28 million for those who had zero trust deployed, showing a 2.3%, or $1.17 million, difference. Unfortunately, 76% of critical infrastructure organizations did not utilise a zero trust architecture. 

Summed up, data breaches are no small thing. The time, money, product, and services that are reduced  as a result of these can be crippling to certain companies or individuals and it is critical, now more than ever, to understand the risks and take preemptive action.
