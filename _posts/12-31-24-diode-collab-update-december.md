The Diode team has released amazing new updates for Diode Collab during the month of December for v1.14.0 - 1.14.1.

**App is now Diode Collab**
<br>Diode Drive is now finally Diode Collab! Diode Collab’s new name is in keeping with the team-collaboration aspect of the app - team use Diode Collab for so much more than files!

**Full Moonbeam Zone Anchoring**
<br>Zone permissions are now anchored by default in Moonbeam, offering faster blocktimes and a larger validator network for smoother updates.

**File Sync Policy**
<br>The new "File Sync Policy" feature lets Zone admins enforce "Two-way," "Upload-only," or member-selected sync modes, with options to disable file syncing entirely for added security.

**Syncing Out of Date Files**
<br>You can now sync entire folders with a single click and update specific files directly via the clickable out-of-date icons—no need to open files individually.

**In-App File and Folder Actions**
<br>You can now Rename, Duplicate, and Move files and folders directly in-app using the new three-dot menu—no need to switch to your system's file explorer.

**PIN to View Backup Code**
<br>If a PIN is configured, your PIN is now required in order to view your backup code.

**Username Auto-Complete**
<br>The invite modal now auto-completes usernames, suggesting contacts as you type.

**Bug Fixes** 
<br>
The team addressed various bugs, including displaying visible nicknames instead of addresses, enabling the deletion of web links, and ensuring that clicking a file preview in chat opens the file.
