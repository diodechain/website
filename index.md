  heading: Zero Trust WireGuard
  content: |
    No server to host.  No vendor risk on the control plane.  Just P2P WireGuard.

    WireGuard was meant to be P2P.  Diode's automated network of UDP relays and encrypted blockchain control plane unleash WireGuard's full potential. 

    If you are in a regulated industry and need to ensure your routes are locked down to known IP addresses, it is as simple as adding one or more autonomous relays.  Automated, efficient, and extremely low maintenance.
