  heading: Communicate securely <br/>across organizations
  content: |
    You discuss sensitive matters with your team, as well as with trusted advisors outside of your organization. 

    Strict confidentiality in discussions with lawyers, advisors, and consultants is essential to protect your projects.

    With Diode, only the people included in the communication have access to the messages.  It is like having a VPN tunnel between each team member.

  heading: File sharing without cloud storage
  content: |
    You need to share files, sometimes even sensitive ones, as you collaborate with your peers.  

    Email attachments are convenient, but not secure enough - you know unintended disclosure can lead to regulatory issues.
  
    With Diode's decentralized architecture, you can share files directly with your team - neither Diode, nor anyone else, has access to them.

  content: |
    You need access to various applications when working remotely - from home or around the world.
    
    GMail, Dropbox, and the like just don’t have military-grade security like we provide. 

    With Diode, you can tunnel directly to your tools, or ensure you are always accessing them from a "safe" region - all from bookmark links built into the app.
