    The Diode App is like a VPN that has built-in team collaboration and asset management features. It is a decentralized “local first” solution that doesn’t rely on third party servers - your team will be operating in one of the most protected environments possible.
  
    The Diode Network ensures that not even Diode has access to your team’s communications, information, or activity.

      Diode doesn’t require any personally identifiable information from you or your team to sign up and get going - all a Diode account requires is a pseudo anonymous username. Whether your team members use a single device or multiple linked devices, they can all be managed via self-custody credentials that are never stored on a server.
