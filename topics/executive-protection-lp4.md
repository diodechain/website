  heading: File sharing without cloud storage
  content: |
    Most executives share files, even sensitive ones, as email attachments. But unintended disclosure can lead to regulatory issues.
  
    With Diode's decentralized architecture, you share files with simple folders, but we never have access to or store your files — so no one else can either.
