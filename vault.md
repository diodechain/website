    The Diode Vault is a tool that extends the presence and reach of your team. It can be deployed in the cloud or as a small box that plugs into power and Ethernet.  Ether way, it will extend the reach of your E2EE collaboration zones.
  
    It relays encrypted messages on behalf of offline team members, backs up files, and provides a private exit node to give your team ex-region Internet access.
