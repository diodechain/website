Create highly secure connected products without needing a cloud service. You can easily integrate partner components as your ecosystem matures - every piece of the system is explicitly identified and managed with Zero Trust security.

#### Enterprise Security and Access Control
Support multiple customers, integrate with enterprise security tools, and even reconfigure permissions later - all without changing your product.

Modern product development often requires integrating multiple systems and components while maintaining security and flexibility. Traditional approaches often create dependencies on cloud services or complex infrastructure.

#### Key Benefits
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Build connected products without requiring cloud services
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every component is explicitly identified and secured
- **Easy Integration**: Simple partner and third-party system integration
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in support for enterprise security requirements
- **Flexible Permissions**: Reconfigure access without product changes
