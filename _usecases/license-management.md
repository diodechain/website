Diode equips every software installation with its own self-custody encryption keys that can be used to provision and manage software licenses.

Traditional software licensing systems rely on centralized servers and complex authentication mechanisms that can be vulnerable to attacks or service disruptions. Diode's approach gives each installation its own cryptographic identity.

#### Key Benefits
- **Self-Custody Keys**: Each installation has its own encryption keys
- **Decentralized Licensing**: No single point of failure
- **Secure Provisioning**: Cryptographically secure license distribution
- **Flexible Management**: Easy license updates and revocation

#### Perfect for:
- Software vendors
- Enterprise software deployments
- IoT device manufacturers
- SaaS providers
