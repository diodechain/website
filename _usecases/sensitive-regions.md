Diode Collab is a secure replacement for Slack and Discord - it stores no data on a server and includes "ZTN" access for your team. No self hosting required.

Operating in sensitive regions requires careful attention to data sovereignty, local regulations, and security requirements. Traditional communication platforms store data on servers that may not comply with local laws or security standards.

#### Key Benefits
- **No Server Storage**: All data remains on your devices, never stored on external servers
- **Zero Trust Network**: Built-in ZTN access without additional infrastructure
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets strict data sovereignty requirements
- **No Self-Hosting**: Secure communication without the burden of managing servers

#### Perfect for:
- International organizations
- Government contractors
- NGOs operating globally
- Companies with strict compliance requirements
