It is quick and easy to use Diode Collab for due diligence on debt, equity, and insurance applications without exposing information to server environments that may retain it indefinitely.

- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of who accessed what and when
- **Quick Setup**: Start due diligence processes immediately

#### Perfect for:
- Investment firms
- Insurance companies
- Banks and lenders
- Private equity
- Venture capital
- Legal firms handling financial transactions
